#Build the wrapper library using the following command:

cd ../
make lib
cd python
python setup.py build

# This will build the required .c files into:

# build/lib.linux-i686-2.5/anomaly.so

# The anomaly.so shared library should be copied into the site-packages directory
# of the python distribution or include the directory containing the shared
# library in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
