<h3 class="section">2.1 What is R?</h3>

<p>R is a system for statistical computation and graphics.  It consists of
a language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a debugger, access
to certain system functions, and the ability to run programs stored in
script files.

   <p>The design of R has been heavily influenced by two existing languages:
Becker, Chambers &amp; Wilks' S (see <a href="#What-is-S_003f">What is S?</a>) and Sussman's
<a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/scheme-repository/home.html">Scheme</a>. 
Whereas the resulting language is very similar in appearance to S, the
underlying implementation and semantics are derived from Scheme. 
See <a href="#What-are-the-differences-between-R-and-S_003f">What are the differences between R and S?</a>, for further details.

   <p>The core of R is an interpreted computer language which allows branching
and looping as well as modular programming using functions.  Most of the
user-visible functions in R are written in R.  It is possible for the
user to interface to procedures written in the C, C++, or FORTRAN
languages for efficiency.  The R distribution contains functionality for
a large number of statistical procedures.  Among these are: linear and
generalized linear models, nonlinear regression models, time series
analysis, classical parametric and nonparametric tests, clustering and
smoothing.  There is also a large set of functions which provide a
flexible graphical environment for creating various kinds of data
presentations.  Additional modules (&ldquo;add-on packages&rdquo;) are available
for a variety of specific purposes (see <a href="#R-Add_002dOn-Packages">R Add-On Packages</a>).

   <p>R was initially written by <a href="mailto:Ross.Ihaka@R-project.org">Ross Ihaka</a>
and <a href="mailto:Robert.Gentleman@R-project.org">Robert Gentleman</a> at the
Department of Statistics of the University of Auckland in Auckland, New
Zealand.  In addition, a large group of individuals has contributed to R
by sending code and bug reports.

   <p>Since mid-1997 there has been a core group (the &ldquo;R Core Team&rdquo;) who can
modify the R source code archive.  The group currently consists of Doug
Bates, John Chambers, Peter Dalgaard, Robert Gentleman, Kurt Hornik,
Stefano Iacus, Ross Ihaka, Friedrich Leisch, Thomas Lumley, Martin
Maechler, Duncan Murdoch, Paul Murrell, Martyn Plummer, Brian Ripley,
Duncan Temple Lang, Luke Tierney, and Simon Urbanek.

   <p>R has a home page at <a href="http://www.R-project.org/">http://www.R-project.org/</a>.  It is
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>
distributed under a <acronym>GNU</acronym>-style
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html">copyleft</a>, and an
official part of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/"><acronym>GNU</acronym></a> project
(&ldquo;<acronym>GNU</acronym> S&rdquo;).

<h3 class="section">2.2 What machines does R run on?</h3>

<p>R is being developed for the Unix, Windows and Mac families of operating
systems.  Support for Mac OS Classic ended with R 1.7.1.

   <p>The current version of R will configure and build under a number of
common Unix platforms including <var>cpu</var>-linux-gnu for the i386, alpha,
arm, hppa, ia64, m68k, mips/mipsel, powerpc, s390, sparc (e.g.,

<h3 class="section">2.3 What is the current version of R?</h3>

<p>The current released version is 2.10.1.  Based on this
`major.minor.patchlevel' numbering scheme, there are two development
versions of R, a patched version of the current release (`r-patched')
and one working towards the next minor or eventually major (`r-devel')
releases of R, respectively.  Version r-patched is for bug fixes mostly. 
New features are typically introduced in r-devel.

<h3 class="section">2.4 How can R be obtained?</h3>

<p>Sources, binaries and documentation for R can be obtained via <acronym>CRAN</acronym>,
the &ldquo;Comprehensive R Archive Network&rdquo; (see <a href="#What-is-CRAN_003f">What is CRAN?</a>).

   <p>Sources are also available via <a href="https://svn.R-project.org/R/">https://svn.R-project.org/R/</a>, the
R Subversion repository, but currently not via anonymous rsync (nor
CVS).

   <p>Tarballs with daily snapshots of the r-devel and r-patched development
versions of R can be found at
<a href="ftp://ftp.stat.math.ethz.ch/Software/R">ftp://ftp.stat.math.ethz.ch/Software/R</a>.

<!-- Sources are also available via anonymous rsync.  Use -->
<!-- @example -->
<!-- rsync -rptC -delete rsync.R-project.org::@var{module} R -->
<!-- @end example -->
<!-- @noindent -->
<!-- to create a copy of the source tree specified by @var{module} in the -->
<!-- subdirectory @file{R} of the current directory, where @var{module} -->
<!-- specifies one of the three existing flavors of the R sources, and can be -->

<h4 class="subsection">2.5.1 How can R be installed (Unix)</h4>

<p>If R is already installed, it can be started by typing <kbd>R</kbd> at the
shell prompt (of course, provided that the executable is in your path).

   <p>If binaries are available for your platform (see <a href="#Are-there-Unix-binaries-for-R_003f">Are there Unix binaries for R?</a>), you can use these, following the instructions that
come with them.

   <p>Otherwise, you can compile and install R yourself, which can be done
very easily under a number of common Unix platforms (see <a href="#What-machines-does-R-run-on_003f">What machines does R run on?</a>).  The file <span class="file">INSTALL</span> that comes with the
R distribution contains a brief introduction, and the &ldquo;R Installation
and Administration&rdquo; guide (see <a href="#What-documentation-exists-for-R_003f">What documentation exists for R?</a>)
has full details.

   <p>Note that you need a FORTRAN compiler or perhaps <span class="command">f2c</span> in
addition to a C compiler to build R.  Also, you need Perl version 5 to
build the R object documentations.  (If this is not available on your
system, you can obtain a PDF version of the object reference manual via
<acronym>CRAN</acronym>.)

   <p>In the simplest case, untar the R source code, change to the directory
thus created, and issue the following commands (at the shell prompt):

<pre class="example">     $ ./configure
     $ make
</pre>
   <p>If these commands execute successfully, the R binary and a shell script
front-end called <span class="file">R</span> are created and copied to the <span class="file">bin</span>
directory.  You can copy the script to a place where users can invoke
it, for example to <span class="file">/usr/local/bin</span>.  In addition, plain text help
pages as well as <acronym>HTML</acronym> and LaTeX versions of the documentation are
built.

   <p>Use <kbd>make dvi</kbd> to create DVI versions of the R manuals, such as
<span class="file">refman.dvi</span> (an R object reference index) and <span class="file">R-exts.dvi</span>,
the &ldquo;R Extension Writers Guide&rdquo;, in the <span class="file">doc/manual</span>
subdirectory.  These files can be previewed and printed using standard
programs such as <span class="command">xdvi</span> and <span class="command">dvips</span>.  You can also use
<kbd>make pdf</kbd> to build PDF (Portable Document Format) version of the
manuals, and view these using e.g. Acrobat.  Manuals written in the
<acronym>GNU</acronym> Texinfo system can also be converted to info files
suitable for reading online with Emacs or stand-alone <acronym>GNU</acronym>
Info; use <kbd>make info</kbd> to create these versions (note that this
requires Makeinfo version 4.5).

   <p>Finally, use <kbd>make check</kbd> to find out whether your R system works
correctly.

   <p>You can also perform a &ldquo;system-wide&rdquo; installation using <kbd>make
install</kbd>.  By default, this will install to the following directories:

     <dl>
<dt><span class="file">${prefix}/bin</span><dd>the front-end shell script
<br><dt><span class="file">${prefix}/man/man1</span><dd>the man page
<br><dt><span class="file">${prefix}/lib/R</span><dd>all the rest (libraries, on-line help system, <small class="dots">...</small>).  This is the &ldquo;R
Home Directory&rdquo; (<span class="env">R_HOME</span>) of the installed system. 
</dl>

<p class="noindent">In the above, <code>prefix</code> is determined during configuration
(typically <span class="file">/usr/local</span>) and can be set by running
<span class="command">configure</span> with the option

<pre class="example">     $ ./configure --prefix=/where/you/want/R/to/go
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(E.g., the R executable will then be installed into
<span class="file">/where/you/want/R/to/go/bin</span>.)

   <p>To install DVI, info and PDF versions of the manuals, use <kbd>make
install-dvi</kbd>, <kbd>make install-info</kbd> and <kbd>make install-pdf</kbd>,
respectively.

   <p>Debian packages, maintained by Dirk Eddelbuettel and Doug Bates, have
long been part of the Debian distribution, and can be accessed through
APT, the Debian package maintenance tool.  Use e.g. <code>apt-get
install r-base r-recommended</code> to install the R environment and
recommended packages.  If you also want to build R packages from source,
also run <code>apt-get install r-base-dev</code> to obtain the additional
tools required for this.  So-called &ldquo;backports&rdquo; of the current R
packages for at least the <dfn>stable</dfn> distribution of Debian are
provided by Johannes Ranke, and available from <acronym>CRAN</acronym>.  See
<a href="http://CRAN.R-project.org/bin/linux/debian/README">http://CRAN.R-project.org/bin/linux/debian/README</a> for details on R
Debian packages and installing the backports, which should also be
suitable for other Debian derivatives.  Native backports for Ubuntu are
provided by Vincent Goulet and Michael Rutter.

   <p>On SUSE, you can set up an installation source for R within Yast by
setting (e.g.)

<pre class="example">     Protocol: HTTP
     Server name: software.openSUSE.org
     Directory: /download/home:/dsteuer/openSUSE_10.2/
</pre>
   <p>With this setting, online updates will check for new versions of R.

<!-- Once you have added that line the programs @command{apt-get}, -->
<!-- @command{apt-cache}, and @command{dselect} (using the apt access -->
<!-- method) will automatically detect and install updates of the R -->
<!-- packages. -->
<!-- The @file{bin/osf} directory of a @CRAN{} site contains RPMs -->
<!-- by Albrecht Gebhardt for alpha systems running Alpha Unix -->
<!-- (OSF/Tru64). -->
<!-- There are also `tar' distributions for NEXTSTEP on the i386 and m68k -->
<!-- platforms in @file{bin/nextstep/i386} and @file{bin/nextstep/m68k}, -->
<!-- created by Stephen Shiboski <steve@biostat.ucsf.edu>. -->
<p>The <span class="file">bin/solaris</span> directory of a <acronym>CRAN</acronym> site contains binary
packages for Solaris on the SPARC and x64 platforms, provided by Mithun
Sridharan.

   <p>No other binary distributions are currently publically available via
<acronym>CRAN</acronym>.

   <p>A &ldquo;live&rdquo; Linux distribution with a particular focus on R is
<dfn>Quantian</dfn>, which provides a directly bootable and self-configuring
&ldquo;Live DVD&rdquo; containing numerous applications of interests to scientists
and researchers, including several hundred <acronym>CRAN</acronym> and Bioconductor
packages, the &ldquo;ESS&rdquo; extensions for Emacs, the &ldquo;JGR&rdquo; Java
<acronym>GUI</acronym> for R, the Ggobi visualization tool as well as several
other R interfaces. The <dfn>Quantian</dfn> website at
<a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/quantian/">http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/quantian/</a> contains more details as

<h3 class="section">2.7 What documentation exists for R?</h3>

<p>Online documentation for most of the functions and variables in R
exists, and can be printed on-screen by typing <kbd>help(</kbd><var>name</var><kbd>)</kbd>
(or <kbd>?</kbd><var>name</var>) at the R prompt, where <var>name</var> is the name of
the topic help is sought for.  (In the case of unary and binary
operators and control-flow special forms, the name may need to be be
quoted.)

   <p>This documentation can also be made available as one reference manual
for on-line reading in <acronym>HTML</acronym> and PDF formats, and as hardcopy via
LaTeX, see <a href="#How-can-R-be-installed_003f">How can R be installed?</a>.  An up-to-date <acronym>HTML</acronym>
version is always available for web browsing at
<a href="http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/">http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/</a>.

   <p>Printed copies of the R reference manual for some version(s) are
available from Network Theory Ltd, at
<a href="http://www.network-theory.co.uk/R/base/">http://www.network-theory.co.uk/R/base/</a>.  For each set of manuals
sold, the publisher donates USD 10 to the R Foundation (see <a href="#What-is-the-R-Foundation_003f">What is the R Foundation?</a>).

   <p>The R distribution also comes with the following manuals.

     <ul>
<li>&ldquo;An Introduction to R&rdquo; (<span class="file">R-intro</span>)
includes information on data types, programming elements, statistical
modeling and graphics.  This document is based on the &ldquo;Notes on
<span class="sc">S-Plus</span>&rdquo; by Bill Venables and David Smith. 
<li>&ldquo;Writing R Extensions&rdquo; (<span class="file">R-exts</span>)
currently describes the process of creating R add-on packages, writing R
documentation, R's system and foreign language interfaces, and the R
<acronym>API</acronym>. 
<li>&ldquo;R Data Import/Export&rdquo; (<span class="file">R-data</span>)
is a guide to importing and exporting data to and from R. 
<li>&ldquo;The R Language Definition&rdquo; (<span class="file">R-lang</span>),
a first version of the &ldquo;Kernighan &amp; Ritchie of R&rdquo;, explains
evaluation, parsing, object oriented programming, computing on the
language, and so forth. 
<li>&ldquo;R Installation and Administration&rdquo; (<span class="file">R-admin</span>). 
<li>&ldquo;R Internals&rdquo; (<span class="file">R-ints</span>)

<h3 class="section">2.9 What mailing lists exist for R?</h3>

<p>Thanks to <a href="mailto:Martin.Maechler@R-project.org">Martin Maechler</a>, there
are four mailing lists devoted to R.

     <dl>
<dt><code>R-announce</code><dd>A moderated list for major announcements about the development of R and
the availability of new code. 
<br><dt><code>R-packages</code><dd>A moderated list for announcements on the availability of new or
enhanced contributed packages. 
<br><dt><code>R-help</code><dd>The `main' R mailing list, for discussion about problems and solutions
using R, announcements (not covered by `R-announce' and `R-packages')
about the development of R and the availability of new code. 
<!-- enhancements and patches to the source code and documentation of R, -->
<!-- comparison and compatibility with S and @SPLUS{}, and for the posting of -->
<!-- nice examples and benchmarks. -->
<br><dt><code>R-devel</code><dd>This list is for questions and discussion about code development in R. 
<!-- discussions about the future of R, proposals of new functionality, and -->
<!-- pre-testing of new versions.  It is meant for those who maintain an -->
<!-- active position in the development of R. -->
</dl>

<p class="noindent">Please read the <a href="http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html">posting guide</a> <em>before</em> sending anything to any mailing list.

   <p>Note in particular that R-help is intended to be comprehensible to
people who want to use R to solve problems but who are not necessarily
interested in or knowledgeable about programming.  Questions likely to
prompt discussion unintelligible to non-programmers (e.g., questions
involving C or C++) should go to R-devel.

   <p>Convenient access to information on these lists, subscription, and
archives is provided by the web interface at
<a href="http://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/">http://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/</a>.  One can also subscribe
(or unsubscribe) via email, e.g. to R-help by sending <span class="samp">subscribe</span>
(or <span class="samp">unsubscribe</span>) in the <em>body</em> of the message (not in the
subject!) to <a href="mailto:R-help-request@lists.R-project.org">R-help-request@lists.R-project.org</a>.

   <p>Send email to <a href="mailto:R-help@lists.R-project.org">R-help@lists.R-project.org</a> to send a message to
everyone on the R-help mailing list.  Subscription and posting to the
other lists is done analogously, with <span class="samp">R-help</span> replaced by
<span class="samp">R-announce</span>, <span class="samp">R-packages</span>, and <span class="samp">R-devel</span>, respectively. 
Note that the R-announce and R-packages lists are gatewayed into R-help. 
Hence, you should subscribe to either of them only in case you are not
subscribed to R-help.

   <p>It is recommended that you send mail to R-help rather than only to the R
Core developers (who are also subscribed to the list, of course).  This
may save them precious time they can use for constantly improving R, and
will typically also result in much quicker feedback for yourself.

   <p>Of course, in the case of bug reports it would be very helpful to have
code which reliably reproduces the problem.  Also, make sure that you
include information on the system and version of R being used.  See
<a href="#R-Bugs">R Bugs</a> for more details.

   <p>See <a href="http://www.R-project.org/mail.html">http://www.R-project.org/mail.html</a> for more information on
the R mailing lists.

   <p>The R Core Team can be reached at <a href="mailto:R-core@lists.R-project.org">R-core@lists.R-project.org</a>
for comments and reports.

   <p>Many of the R project's mailing lists are also available via
<a href="http://gmane.org">Gmane</a>, from which they can be read with a web
browser, using an NNTP news reader, or via RSS feeds.  See
<a href="http://dir.gmane.org/index.php?prefix=gmane.comp.lang.r.">http://dir.gmane.org/index.php?prefix=gmane.comp.lang.r.</a> for

you have any questions regarding the legality of using R in any
particular situation you should bring it up with your legal counsel.  We
are in no position to offer legal advice.

   <p>It is the opinion of the R Core Team that one can use R for commercial
purposes (e.g., in business or in consulting).  The <acronym>GPL</acronym>, like
all Open Source licenses, permits all and any use of the package.  It
only restricts distribution of R or of other programs containing code
from R.  This is made clear in clause 6 (&ldquo;No Discrimination Against
Fields of Endeavor&rdquo;) of the
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.html">Open Source Definition</a>:

   <blockquote>
The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a
specific field of endeavor.  For example, it may not restrict the
program from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic
research. 
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent">It is also explicitly stated in clause 0 of the GPL, which says in part

   <blockquote>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running
the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program. 
</blockquote>

   <p>Most add-on packages, including all recommended ones, also explicitly
allow commercial use in this way.  A few packages are restricted to
&ldquo;non-commercial use&rdquo;; you should contact the author to clarify whether
these may be used or seek the advice of your legal counsel.

<h3 class="section">3.1 What is S?</h3>

<p>S is a very high level language and an environment for data analysis and
graphics.  In 1998, the Association for Computing Machinery
(<acronym>ACM</acronym>) presented its Software System Award to John M. Chambers,
the principal designer of S, for

   <blockquote>
the S system, which has forever altered the way people analyze,
visualize, and manipulate data <small class="dots">...</small>

        <p>S is an elegant, widely accepted, and enduring software system, with
conceptual integrity, thanks to the insight, taste, and effort of John
Chambers.

   <p>The evolution of the S language is characterized by four books by John
Chambers and coauthors, which are also the primary references for S.

<h3 class="section">3.3 What are the differences between R and S?</h3>

<p>We can regard S as a language with three current implementations or
&ldquo;engines&rdquo;, the &ldquo;old S engine&rdquo; (S version 3; <span class="sc">S-Plus</span> 3.x and 4.x),
the &ldquo;new S engine&rdquo; (S version 4; <span class="sc">S-Plus</span> 5.x and above), and R. 
Given this understanding, asking for &ldquo;the differences between R and S&rdquo;
really amounts to asking for the specifics of the R implementation of
the S language, i.e., the difference between the R and S <em>engines</em>.

   <p>For the remainder of this section, &ldquo;S&rdquo; refers to the S engines and not
the S language.

<h4 class="subsection">3.3.1 Lexical scoping</h4>

<p>Contrary to other implementations of the S language, R has adopted an
evaluation model in which nested function definitions are lexically
scoped.  This is analogous to the evaluation model in Scheme.

   <p>This difference becomes manifest when <em>free</em> variables occur in a
function.  Free variables are those which are neither formal parameters
(occurring in the argument list of the function) nor local variables
(created by assigning to them in the body of the function).  In S, the
values of free variables are determined by a set of global variables
(similar to C, there is only local and global scope).  In R, they are
determined by the environment in which the function was created.

   <p>Consider the following function:

<pre class="example">     cube &lt;- function(n) {
       sq &lt;- function() n * n
       n * sq()
     }
</pre>
   <p>Under S, <code>sq()</code> does not &ldquo;know&rdquo; about the variable <code>n</code>
unless it is defined globally:

<pre class="example">     S&gt; cube(2)
     Error in sq():  Object "n" not found
     Dumped
     S&gt; n &lt;- 3
     S&gt; cube(2)
     [1] 18
</pre>
   <p>In R, the &ldquo;environment&rdquo; created when <code>cube()</code> was invoked is
also looked in:

<pre class="example">     R&gt; cube(2)
     [1] 8
</pre>
   <!-- The following more `realistic' example illustrating the differences in -->
<!-- scoping is due to @email{tlumley@@u.washington.edu, Thomas Lumley}. -->
<!-- The function -->
<!-- @example -->
<!-- jackknife.lm <- function(lmobj) @{ -->
<!-- n <- length(resid(lmobj)) -->
<!-- jval <- sapply(1:n, function(i) coef(update(lmobj, subset = -i))) -->
<!-- (n - 1) * (n - 1) * var(jval) / n -->
<!-- @} -->
<!-- @end example -->
<!-- @noindent -->
<!-- does something useful in R, but does not work in S.  In order to make it -->
<!-- work in S you need to explicitly pass the linear model object into the -->
<!-- function nested in @code{apply()}.  If you don't and you are lucky you -->
<!-- will get @samp{Error: Object "lmobj" not found}.  If you are unlucky -->
<!-- enough to have a linear model called @code{lmobj} in your global -->
<!-- environment you will get the wrong answer with no warning. -->
<!-- The following version works in S. -->
<!-- @example -->
<!-- jackknife.S.lm <- function(lmobj) @{ -->
<!-- n <- length(resid(lmobj)) -->
<!-- jval <- sapply(1:n, -->
<!-- function(i, lmobj) coef(update(lmobj, subset = -i)), -->
<!-- lmobj = lmobj) -->
<!-- (n - 1) * (n - 1) * var(jval) / n -->
<!-- @} -->
<!-- @end example -->
<!-- (The S version was written independently by Thomas and at least three of -->
<!-- his fellow students over the past couple of years, causing literally -->
<!-- hours of confusion on each occasion.) -->
<p>As a more &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; real-world problem, suppose you want to write
a function which returns the density function of the r-th order
statistic from a sample of size n from a (continuous)
distribution.  For simplicity, we shall use both the cdf and pdf of the
distribution as explicit arguments.  (Example compiled from various
postings by Luke Tierney.)

   <p>The <span class="sc">S-Plus</span> documentation for <code>call()</code> basically suggests the
following:

<pre class="example">     dorder &lt;- function(n, r, pfun, dfun) {
       f &lt;- function(x) NULL
       con &lt;- round(exp(lgamma(n + 1) - lgamma(r) - lgamma(n - r + 1)))
       PF &lt;- call(substitute(pfun), as.name("x"))
       DF &lt;- call(substitute(dfun), as.name("x"))
       f[[length(f)]] &lt;-
         call("*", con,
              call("*", call("^", PF, r - 1),
                   call("*", call("^", call("-", 1, PF), n - r),
                        DF)))
       f
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Rather tricky, isn't it?  The code uses the fact that in S,
functions are just lists of special mode with the function body as the
last argument, and hence does not work in R (one could make the idea
work, though).

   <p>A version which makes heavy use of <code>substitute()</code> and seems to work
under both S and R is

<pre class="example">     dorder &lt;- function(n, r, pfun, dfun) {
       con &lt;- round(exp(lgamma(n + 1) - lgamma(r) - lgamma(n - r + 1)))
       eval(substitute(function(x) K * PF(x)^a * (1 - PF(x))^b * DF(x),
                       list(PF = substitute(pfun), DF = substitute(dfun),
                            a = r - 1, b = n - r, K = con)))
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(the <code>eval()</code> is not needed in S).

   <p>However, in R there is a much easier solution:

<pre class="example">     dorder &lt;- function(n, r, pfun, dfun) {
       con &lt;- round(exp(lgamma(n + 1) - lgamma(r) - lgamma(n - r + 1)))
       function(x) {
         con * pfun(x)^(r - 1) * (1 - pfun(x))^(n - r) * dfun(x)
       }
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This seems to be the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; implementation, and it works because
the free variables in the returned function can be looked up in the
defining environment (this is lexical scope).

   <p>Note that what you really need is the function <em>closure</em>, i.e., the
body along with all variable bindings needed for evaluating it.  Since
in the above version, the free variables in the value function are not
modified, you can actually use it in S as well if you abstract out the
closure operation into a function <code>MC()</code> (for &ldquo;make closure&rdquo;):

<pre class="example">     dorder &lt;- function(n, r, pfun, dfun) {
       con &lt;- round(exp(lgamma(n + 1) - lgamma(r) - lgamma(n - r + 1)))
       MC(function(x) {
            con * pfun(x)^(r - 1) * (1 - pfun(x))^(n - r) * dfun(x)
          },
          list(con = con, pfun = pfun, dfun = dfun, r = r, n = n))
     }
</pre>
   <p>Given the appropriate definitions of the closure operator, this works in
both R and S, and is much &ldquo;cleaner&rdquo; than a substitute/eval solution
(or one which overrules the default scoping rules by using explicit
access to evaluation frames, as is of course possible in both R and S).

   <p>For R, <code>MC()</code> simply is

<pre class="example">     MC &lt;- function(f, env) f
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(lexical scope!), a version for S is

<pre class="example">     MC &lt;- function(f, env = NULL) {
       env &lt;- as.list(env)
       if (mode(f) != "function")
         stop(paste("not a function:", f))
       if (length(env) &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; any(names(env) == ""))
         stop(paste("not all arguments are named:", env))
       fargs &lt;- if(length(f) &gt; 1) f[1:(length(f) - 1)] else NULL
       fargs &lt;- c(fargs, env)
       if (any(duplicated(names(fargs))))
         stop(paste("duplicated arguments:", paste(names(fargs)),
              collapse = ", "))
       fbody &lt;- f[length(f)]
       cf &lt;- c(fargs, fbody)
       mode(cf) &lt;- "function"
       return(cf)
     }
</pre>
   <p>Similarly, most optimization (or zero-finding) routines need some
arguments to be optimized over and have other parameters that depend on
the data but are fixed with respect to optimization.  With R scoping
rules, this is a trivial problem; simply make up the function with the
required definitions in the same environment and scoping takes care of
it.  With S, one solution is to add an extra parameter to the function
and to the optimizer to pass in these extras, which however can only
work if the optimizer supports this.

   <p>Nested lexically scoped functions allow using function closures and
maintaining local state.  A simple example (taken from Abelson and
Sussman) is obtained by typing <kbd>demo("scoping")</kbd> at the R prompt.

Language for Data Analysis and Graphics&rdquo; (see <a href="#What-documentation-exists-for-R_003f">What documentation exists for R?</a>) and in Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka (2000), &ldquo;Lexical
Scope and Statistical Computing&rdquo;,
<a href="http://www.amstat.org/publications/jcgs/"><em>Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics</em></a>, <strong>9</strong>, 491&ndash;508.

   <p>Nested lexically scoped functions also imply a further major difference. 
Whereas S stores all objects as separate files in a directory somewhere
(usually <span class="file">.Data</span> under the current directory), R does not.  All
objects in R are stored internally.  When R is started up it grabs a
piece of memory and uses it to store the objects.  R performs its own
memory management of this piece of memory, growing and shrinking its
size as needed.  Having everything in memory is necessary because it is
not really possible to externally maintain all relevant &ldquo;environments&rdquo;
of symbol/value pairs.  This difference also seems to make R
<em>faster</em> than S.

   <p>The down side is that if R crashes you will lose all the work for the
current session.  Saving and restoring the memory &ldquo;images&rdquo; (the
functions and data stored in R's internal memory at any time) can be a
bit slow, especially if they are big.  In S this does not happen,
because everything is saved in disk files and if you crash nothing is
likely to happen to them.  (In fact, one might conjecture that the S
developers felt that the price of changing their approach to persistent
storage just to accommodate lexical scope was far too expensive.) 
Hence, when doing important work, you might consider saving often (see
<a href="#How-can-I-save-my-workspace_003f">How can I save my workspace?</a>) to safeguard against possible
crashes.  Other possibilities are logging your sessions, or have your R
commands stored in text files which can be read in using
<code>source()</code>.

   <blockquote>
<b>Note:</b> If you run R from within Emacs (see <a href="#R-and-Emacs">R and Emacs</a>), you can save the
contents of the interaction buffer to a file and conveniently manipulate
it using <code>ess-transcript-mode</code>, as well as save source copies of
all functions and data used.

<h4 class="subsection">3.3.2 Models</h4>

<p>There are some differences in the modeling code, such as

     <ul>
<li>Whereas in S, you would use <code>lm(y ~ x^3)</code> to regress <code>y</code> on
<code>x^3</code>, in R, you have to insulate powers of numeric vectors (using
<code>I()</code>), i.e., you have to use <code>lm(y ~ I(x^3))</code>. 
<li>The glm family objects are implemented differently in R and S.  The same
functionality is available but the components have different names. 
<li>Option <code>na.action</code> is set to <code>"na.omit"</code> by default in R,
but not set in S. 
<li>Terms objects are stored differently.  In S a terms object is an
expression with attributes, in R it is a formula with attributes.  The
attributes have the same names but are mostly stored differently. 
<li>Finally, in R <code>y ~ x + 0</code> is an alternative to <code>y ~ x - 1</code> for
specifying a model with no intercept.  Models with no parameters at all
can be specified by <code>y ~ 0</code>.

<h4 class="subsection">3.3.3 Others</h4>

<p>Apart from lexical scoping and its implications, R follows the S
language definition in the Blue and White Books as much as possible, and
hence really is an &ldquo;implementation&rdquo; of S.  There are some intentional
differences where the behavior of S is considered &ldquo;not clean&rdquo;.  In
general, the rationale is that R should help you detect programming
errors, while at the same time being as compatible as possible with S.

   <p>Some known differences are the following.

     <ul>
<li>In R, if <code>x</code> is a list, then <code>x[i] &lt;- NULL</code> and <code>x[[i]]
&lt;- NULL</code> remove the specified elements from <code>x</code>.  The first of
these is incompatible with S, where it is a no-op.  (Note that you can
set elements to <code>NULL</code> using <code>x[i] &lt;- list(NULL)</code>.)

     <!-- @item -->
<!-- In R @code{x[-4]} fails if @code{x} is not @code{NULL} but has fewer -->
<!-- than 4 elements.  In S it has no effect. -->
<li>In S, the functions named <code>.First</code> and <code>.Last</code> in the
<span class="file">.Data</span> directory can be used for customizing, as they are executed
at the very beginning and end of a session, respectively.

     <p>In R, the startup mechanism is as follows.  Unless <span class="option">--no-environ</span>
was given on the command line, R searches for site and user files to
process for setting environment variables.  Then, R searches for a
site-wide startup profile unless the command line option
<span class="option">--no-site-file</span> was given.  This code is loaded in package
<strong>base</strong>.  Then, unless <span class="option">--no-init-file</span> was given, R
searches for a user profile file, and sources it into the user
workspace.  It then loads a saved image of the user workspace from
<span class="file">.RData</span> in case there is one (unless <span class="option">--no-restore-data</span> or
<span class="option">--no-restore</span> were specified).  Next, a function <code>.First()</code>
is run if found on the search path.  Finally, function <code>.First.sys</code>
in the <strong>base</strong> package is run.  When terminating an R session, by
default a function <code>.Last</code> is run if found on the search path,
followed by <code>.Last.sys</code>.  If needed, the functions <code>.First()</code>
and <code>.Last()</code> should be defined in the appropriate startup
profiles.  See the help pages for <code>.First</code> and <code>.Last</code> for
more details.

     <li>In R, <code>T</code> and <code>F</code> are just variables being set to <code>TRUE</code>
and <code>FALSE</code>, respectively, but are not reserved words as in S and
hence can be overwritten by the user.  (This helps e.g. when you have
factors with levels <code>"T"</code> or <code>"F"</code>.)  Hence, when writing code
you should always use <code>TRUE</code> and <code>FALSE</code>.

     <li>In R, <code>dyn.load()</code> can only load <em>shared objects</em>, as created
for example by <kbd>R CMD SHLIB</kbd>.

     <li>In R, <code>attach()</code> currently only works for lists and data frames,
but not for directories.  (In fact, <code>attach()</code> also works for R
data files created with <code>save()</code>, which is analogous to attaching
directories in S.)  Also, you cannot attach at position 1.

     <li>Categories do not exist in R, and never will as they are deprecated now
in S.  Use factors instead.

     <li>In R, <code>For()</code> loops are not necessary and hence not supported.

     <li>In R, <code>assign()</code> uses the argument <span class="option">envir=</span> rather than
<span class="option">where=</span> as in S.

     <li>The random number generators are different, and the seeds have different
length.

     <li>R passes integer objects to C as <code>int *</code> rather than <code>long *</code>
as in S.

     <li>R has no single precision storage mode.  However, as of version 0.65.1,
there is a single precision interface to C/FORTRAN subroutines.

     <li>By default, <code>ls()</code> returns the names of the objects in the current
(under R) and global (under S) environment, respectively.  For example,
given

     <pre class="example">          x &lt;- 1; fun &lt;- function() {y &lt;- 1; ls()}
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">then <code>fun()</code> returns <code>"y"</code> in R and <code>"x"</code> (together with
the rest of the global environment) in S.

     <li>R allows for zero-extent matrices (and arrays, i.e., some elements of
the <code>dim</code> attribute vector can be 0).  This has been determined a
useful feature as it helps reducing the need for special-case tests for
empty subsets.  For example, if <code>x</code> is a matrix, <code>x[, FALSE]</code>
is not <code>NULL</code> but a &ldquo;matrix&rdquo; with 0 columns.  Hence, such objects
need to be tested for by checking whether their <code>length()</code> is zero
(which works in both R and S), and not using <code>is.null()</code>.

     <li>Named vectors are considered vectors in R but not in S (e.g.,
<code>is.vector(c(a = 1:3))</code> returns <code>FALSE</code> in S and <code>TRUE</code>
in R).

     <li>Data frames are not considered as matrices in R (i.e., if <code>DF</code> is a
data frame, then <code>is.matrix(DF)</code> returns <code>FALSE</code> in R and
<code>TRUE</code> in S).

     <li>R by default uses treatment contrasts in the unordered case, whereas S
uses the Helmert ones.  This is a deliberate difference reflecting the
opinion that treatment contrasts are more natural.

     <li>In R, the argument of a replacement function which corresponds to the
right hand side must be named <span class="samp">value</span>.  E.g., <code>f(a) &lt;- b</code> is
evaluated as <code>a &lt;- "f&lt;-"(a, value = b)</code>.  S always takes the last
argument, irrespective of its name.

     <li>In S, <code>substitute()</code> searches for names for substitution in the
given expression in three places: the actual and the default arguments
of the matching call, and the local frame (in that order).  R looks in
the local frame only, with the special rule to use a &ldquo;promise&rdquo; if a
variable is not evaluated.  Since the local frame is initialized with
the actual arguments or the default expressions, this is usually
equivalent to S, until assignment takes place.

     <li>In S, the index variable in a <code>for()</code> loop is local to the inside
of the loop.  In R it is local to the environment where the <code>for()</code>
statement is executed.

     <li>In S, <code>tapply(simplify=TRUE)</code> returns a vector where R returns a
one-dimensional array (which can have named dimnames).

     <li>In S(-<span class="sc">Plus</span>) the C locale is used, whereas in R the current
operating system locale is used for determining which characters are
alphanumeric and how they are sorted.  This affects the set of valid
names for R objects (for example accented chars may be allowed in R) and
ordering in sorts and comparisons (such as whether <code>"aA" &lt; "Bb"</code> is
true or false).  From version 1.2.0 the locale can be (re-)set in R by
the <code>Sys.setlocale()</code> function.

     <li>In S, <code>missing(</code><var>arg</var><code>)</code> remains <code>TRUE</code> if <var>arg</var> is
subsequently modified; in R it doesn't.

     <li>From R version 1.3.0, <code>data.frame</code> strips <code>I()</code> when creating
(column) names.

     <li>In R, the string <code>"NA"</code> is not treated as a missing value in a
character variable.  Use <code>as.character(NA)</code> to create a missing
character value.

     <li>R disallows repeated formal arguments in function calls.

     <li>In S, <code>dump()</code>, <code>dput()</code> and <code>deparse()</code> are essentially
different interfaces to the same code.  In R from version 2.0.0, this is
only true if the same <code>control</code> argument is used, but by default it
is not.  By default <code>dump()</code> tries to write code that will evaluate
to reproduce the object, whereas <code>dput()</code> and <code>deparse()</code>
default to options for producing deparsed code that is readable.

     <li>In R, indexing a vector, matrix, array or data frame with <code>[</code> using
a character vector index looks only for exact matches (whereas <code>[[</code>
and <code>$</code> allow partial matches).  In S, <code>[</code> allows partial
matches.

     <li>S has a two-argument version of <code>atan</code> and no <code>atan2</code>.  A call
in S such as <code>atan(x1, x2)</code> is equivalent to R's <code>atan2(x1,
x2)</code>.  However, beware of named arguments since S's <code>atan(x = a, y
= b)</code> is equivalent to R's <code>atan2(y = a, x = b)</code> with the meanings
of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> interchanged.  (R used to have undocumented
support for a two-argument <code>atan</code> with positional arguments, but
this has been withdrawn to avoid further confusion.)

     <li>Numeric constants with no fractional and exponent (i.e., only integer)
part are taken as integer in <span class="sc">S-Plus</span> 6.x or later, but as double in R.

   </ul>

   <p>There are also differences which are not intentional, and result from
missing or incorrect code in R.  The developers would appreciate hearing
about any deficiencies you may find (in a written report fully
documenting the difference as you see it).  Of course, it would be
useful if you were to implement the change yourself and make sure it
works.

<p>Since almost anything you can do in R has source code that you could

in R that you couldn't do in <span class="sc">S-Plus</span> if you wanted to.  (Note that

gamma correction for color, and, most importantly, mathematical
annotation in plot texts, via input expressions reminiscent of TeX
constructs.  See the help page for <code>plotmath</code>, which features an
impressive on-line example.  More details can be found in Paul Murrell

<h2 class="chapter">4 R Web Interfaces</h2>

<p><strong>Rweb</strong> is developed and maintained by
<a href="mailto:jeff@math.montana.edu">Jeff Banfield</a>.  The
<a href="http://www.math.montana.edu/Rweb/">Rweb Home Page</a> provides access
to all three versions of Rweb&mdash;a simple text entry form that returns
output and graphs, a more sophisticated JavaScript version that provides
a multiple window environment, and a set of point and click modules that
are useful for introductory statistics courses and require no knowledge
of the R language.  All of the Rweb versions can analyze Web accessible
datasets if a <acronym>URL</acronym> is provided.

   <p>The paper &ldquo;Rweb: Web-based Statistical Analysis&rdquo;, providing a detailed
explanation of the different versions of Rweb and an overview of how
Rweb works, was published in the Journal of Statistical Software
(<a href="http://www.jstatsoft.org/v04/i01/">http://www.jstatsoft.org/v04/i01/</a>).

   <p><a href="mailto:ulfi@cs.tu-berlin.de">Ulf Bartel</a> has developed
<strong>R-Online</strong>, a simple on-line programming environment for R which
intends to make the first steps in statistical programming with R
(especially with time series) as easy as possible.  There is no need for
a local installation since the only requirement for the user is a
JavaScript capable browser.  See <a href="http://osvisions.com/r-online/">http://osvisions.com/r-online/</a>
for more information.

   <p><strong>Rcgi</strong> is a CGI WWW interface to R by <a href="mailto:mjr@dsl.pipex.com">MJ Ray</a>.  It had the ability to use &ldquo;embedded code&rdquo;: you could mix
user input and code, allowing the <acronym>HTML</acronym> author to do anything from
load in data sets to enter most of the commands for users without
writing CGI scripts.  Graphical output was possible in PostScript or GIF
formats and the executed code was presented to the user for revision. 
However, it is not clear if the project is still active. 
<!-- URL no longer seems to work ... -->
<!-- See @url{http://stats.mth.uea.ac.uk/Rcgi/} for more information. -->
Currently, a modified version of <strong>Rcgi</strong> by
<a href="mailto:mai@ms.uky.edu">Mai Zhou</a> (actually, two versions: one with
(bitmap) graphics and one without) as well as the original code are
available from <a href="http://www.ms.uky.edu/~statweb/">http://www.ms.uky.edu/~statweb/</a>.

   <p>CGI-based web access to R is also provided at
<a href="http://hermes.sdu.dk/cgi-bin/go/">http://hermes.sdu.dk/cgi-bin/go/</a>.  There are many additional
examples of web interfaces to R which basically allow to submit R code
to a remote server, see for example the collection of links available from
<a href="http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/twiki/bin/view/Main/StatCompCourse">http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/twiki/bin/view/Main/StatCompCourse</a>.

   <p><a href="http://www.warwick.ac.uk/go/dfirth">David Firth</a> has written
<strong>CGIwithR</strong>, an R add-on package available from <acronym>CRAN</acronym>.  It
provides some simple extensions to R to facilitate running R scripts
through the CGI interface to a web server, and allows submission of data
using both GET and POST methods.  It is easily installed using Apache
under Linux and in principle should run on any platform that supports R
and a web server provided that the installer has the necessary security
permissions.  David's paper &ldquo;CGIwithR: Facilities for Processing Web
Forms Using R&rdquo; was published in the Journal of Statistical Software
(<a href="http://www.jstatsoft.org/v08/i10/">http://www.jstatsoft.org/v08/i10/</a>).  The package is now
maintained by <a href="mailto:duncan@wald.ucdavis.edu">Duncan Temple Lang</a> and
has a web page at <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/CGIwithR/">http://www.omegahat.org/CGIwithR/</a>.

   <p><a href="http://www.rpad.org/Rpad">Rpad</a>, developed and actively maintained
by Tom Short, provides a sophisticated environment which combines some
of the features of the previous approaches with quite a bit of
JavaScript, allowing for a <acronym>GUI</acronym>-like behavior (with sortable
tables, clickable graphics, editable output), etc.

   <p>Jeff Horner is working on the R/Apache Integration Project which embeds
the R interpreter inside Apache 2 (and beyond).  A tutorial and
presentation are available from the project web page at
<a href="http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/twiki/bin/view/Main/RApacheProject">http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/twiki/bin/view/Main/RApacheProject</a>.

   <p><a href="http://stats.math.uni-augsburg.de/Rserve/">Rserve</a> is a project
actively developed by Simon Urbanek.  It implements a TCP/IP server which
allows other programs to use facilities of R.  Clients are available from
the web site for Java and C++ (and could be written for other languages
that support TCP/IP sockets).

   <p><a href="http://openstatserver.org/index.html">OpenStatServer</a> is being
developed by a team lead by Greg Warnes; it aims &ldquo;to provide clean access
to computational modules defined in a variety of computational
environments (R, SAS, Matlab, etc) via a single well-defined client
interface&rdquo; and to turn computational services into web services.

   <p>Two projects use PHP to provide a web interface to R. 
<a href="http://steve-chen.net/R_PHP/">R_PHP_Online</a> by Steve Chen (though
it is unclear if this project is still active) is somewhat similar to
the above Rcgi and Rweb.  <a href="http://dssm.unipa.it/R-php/?cmd=home">R-php</a> is actively developed by Alfredo Pontillo and Angelo Mineo and
provides both a web interface to R and a set of pre-specified analyses
that need no R code input.

   <p><a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/">webbioc</a> is &ldquo;an integrated web
interface for doing microarray analysis using several of the
Bioconductor packages&rdquo; and is designed to be installed at local sites
as a shared computing resource.

   <p>Finally, <a href="http://rwui.cryst.bbk.ac.uk">Rwui</a> is a web application to
to create user-friendly web interfaces for R scripts.  All code for the
web interface is created automatically.  There is no need for the user
to do any extra scripting or learn any new scripting techniques.

<h4 class="subsection">5.1.4 Add-on packages from Bioconductor</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor</a> is an open source and
open development software project for the analysis and comprehension of
genomic data.  Most Bioconductor components are distributed as R add-on
packages.  Initially most of the
<a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/bioc/">Bioconductor software packages</a> focused primarily on DNA microarray data analysis.  As the
project has matured, the functional scope of the software packages
broadened to include the analysis of all types of genomic data, such as
SAGE, sequence, or SNP data.  In addition, there are metadata
(annotation, CDF and probe) and experiment data packages.  See
<a href="http://www.bioconductor.org/download/">http://www.bioconductor.org/download/</a> for available packages and a
complete taxonomy via BioC Views.

<h3 class="section">5.2 How can add-on packages be installed?</h3>

<p>(Unix only.)  The add-on packages on <acronym>CRAN</acronym> come as gzipped tar files
named <var>pkg</var><code>_</code><var>version</var><code>.tar.gz</code>, which may in fact be
&ldquo;bundles&rdquo; containing more than one package.  Let <var>path</var> be the
path to such a package file.  Provided that <span class="command">tar</span> and
<span class="command">gzip</span> are available on your system, type

<pre class="example">     $ R CMD INSTALL <var>path</var>/<var>pkg</var>_<var>version</var>.tar.gz
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">at the shell prompt to install to the library tree rooted at the first
directory in your library search path (see the help page for
<code>.libPaths()</code> for details on how the search path is determined).

   <p>To install to another tree (e.g., your private one), use

<pre class="example">     $ R CMD INSTALL -l <var>lib</var> <var>path</var>/<var>pkg</var>_<var>version</var>.tar.gz
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <var>lib</var> gives the path to the library tree to install to.

   <p>Even more conveniently, you can install and automatically update
packages from within R if you have access to repositories such as
<acronym>CRAN</acronym>.  See the help page for <code>available.packages()</code> for more
information.

<!-- <COMMENT> -->
<!-- This is really no longer quite accurate (R_LIBS_USER is preferred to -->
<!-- R_LIBS), and described in ?libPaths anyways ... hence comment out. -->
<!-- You can use several library trees of add-on packages.  The easiest way -->

<!-- which should be a colon-separated list of directories at which R library -->
<!-- trees are rooted.  You do not have to specify the default tree in -->

<!-- @example -->
<!-- R_LIBS="$HOME/lib/R:/usr/local/lib/R-contrib"; export R_LIBS -->

<h3 class="section">6.1 Is there Emacs support for R?</h3>

<p>There is an Emacs package called <acronym>ESS</acronym> (&ldquo;Emacs Speaks
Statistics&rdquo;) which provides a standard interface between statistical
programs and statistical processes.  It is intended to provide
assistance for interactive statistical programming and data analysis. 
Languages supported include: S dialects (R, S 3/4, and <span class="sc">S-Plus</span>
3.x/4.x/5.x/6.x/7.x), LispStat dialects (XLispStat, ViSta), SAS, Stata,
and BUGS.

   <p><acronym>ESS</acronym> grew out of the need for bug fixes and extensions to
S-mode 4.8 (which was a <acronym>GNU</acronym> Emacs interface to S/<span class="sc">S-Plus</span>
version 3 only).  The current set of developers desired support for
XEmacs, R, S4, and MS Windows.  In addition, with new modes being
developed for R, Stata, and SAS, it was felt that a unifying interface
and framework for the user interface would benefit both the user and the
developer, by helping both groups conform to standard Emacs usage.  The
end result is an increase in efficiency for statistical programming and
data analysis, over the usual tools.

   <p>R support contains code for editing R source code (syntactic indentation
and highlighting of source code, partial evaluations of code, loading
and error-checking of code, and source code revision maintenance) and
documentation (syntactic indentation and highlighting of source code,
sending examples to running <acronym>ESS</acronym> process, and previewing),
interacting with an inferior R process from within Emacs (command-line
editing, searchable command history, command-line completion of R object
and file names, quick access to object and search lists, transcript
recording, and an interface to the help system), and transcript
manipulation (recording and saving transcript files, manipulating and
editing saved transcripts, and re-evaluating commands from transcript
files).

   <p>The latest stable version of <acronym>ESS</acronym> are available via <acronym>CRAN</acronym> or
the <a href="http://ESS.R-project.org/">ESS web page</a>.  The <acronym>HTML</acronym> version
of the documentation can be found at <a href="http://stat.ethz.ch/ESS/">http://stat.ethz.ch/ESS/</a>.

   <p><acronym>ESS</acronym> comes with detailed installation instructions.

   <p>For help with <acronym>ESS</acronym>, send email to
<a href="mailto:ESS-help@stat.math.ethz.ch">ESS-help@stat.math.ethz.ch</a>.

   <p>Please send bug reports and suggestions on <acronym>ESS</acronym> to
<a href="mailto:ESS-bugs@stat.math.ethz.ch">ESS-bugs@stat.math.ethz.ch</a>.  The easiest way to do this from is
within Emacs by typing <kbd>M-x ess-submit-bug-report</kbd> or using the
[ESS] or [iESS] pulldown menus.

<h3 class="section">6.2 Should I run R from within Emacs?</h3>

<p>Yes, <em>definitely</em>.  Inferior R mode provides a readline/history
mechanism, object name completion, and syntax-based highlighting of the
interaction buffer using Font Lock mode, as well as a very convenient
interface to the R help system.

   <p>Of course, it also integrates nicely with the mechanisms for editing R
source using Emacs.  One can write code in one Emacs buffer and send
whole or parts of it for execution to R; this is helpful for both data
analysis and programming.  One can also seamlessly integrate with a
revision control system, in order to maintain a log of changes in your
programs and data, as well as to allow for the retrieval of past
versions of the code.

   <p>In addition, it allows you to keep a record of your session, which can
also be used for error recovery through the use of the transcript mode.

   <p>To specify command line arguments for the inferior R process, use
<kbd>C-u M-x R</kbd> for starting R.

<!-- This prompts you for the arguments; in particular, you can increase -->
<!-- the memory size this way (@pxref{Why does R run out of memory?}). -->

<h3 class="section">6.3 Debugging R from within Emacs</h3>

<p>To debug R &ldquo;from within Emacs&rdquo;, there are several possibilities.  To
use the Emacs GUD (Grand Unified Debugger) library with the recommended
debugger GDB, type <kbd>M-x gdb</kbd> and give the path to the R
<em>binary</em> as argument.  At the <span class="command">gdb</span> prompt, set
<span class="env">R_HOME</span> and other environment variables as needed (using e.g. 
<kbd>set env R_HOME /path/to/R/</kbd>, but see also below), and start the
binary with the desired arguments (e.g., <kbd>run --quiet</kbd>).

   <p>If you have <acronym>ESS</acronym>, you can do <kbd>C-u M-x R &lt;RET&gt; - d
&lt;SPC&gt; g d b &lt;RET&gt;</kbd> to start an inferior R process with arguments
<span class="option">-d gdb</span>.

   <p>A third option is to start an inferior R process via <acronym>ESS</acronym>
(<kbd>M-x R</kbd>) and then start GUD (<kbd>M-x gdb</kbd>) giving the R binary
(using its full path name) as the program to debug.  Use the program
<span class="command">ps</span> to find the process number of the currently running R
process then use the <code>attach</code> command in gdb to attach it to that
process.  One advantage of this method is that you have separate
<code>*R*</code> and <code>*gud-gdb*</code> windows.  Within the <code>*R*</code> window
you have all the <acronym>ESS</acronym> facilities, such as object-name
completion, that we know and love.

   <p>When using GUD mode for debugging from within Emacs, you may find it
most convenient to use the directory with your code in it as the current
working directory and then make a symbolic link from that directory to
the R binary.  That way <span class="file">.gdbinit</span> can stay in the directory with
the code and be used to set up the environment and the search paths for
the source, e.g. as follows:

<pre class="example">     set env R_HOME /opt/R
     set env R_PAPERSIZE letter
     set env R_PRINTCMD lpr
     dir /opt/R/src/appl
     dir /opt/R/src/main
     dir /opt/R/src/nmath
     dir /opt/R/src/unix

   <p class="noindent">to set component <code>i</code> of the list <code>x</code> to <code>NULL</code>, similarly

the list.

   <p>For dropping the row names of a matrix <code>x</code>, it may be easier to use
<code>rownames(x) &lt;- NULL</code>, similarly for column names.

<h3 class="section">7.4 How can I get eval() and D() to work?</h3>

<p>Strange things will happen if you use <code>eval(print(x), envir = e)</code>
or <code>D(x^2, "x")</code>.  The first one will either tell you that
"<code>x</code>" is not found, or print the value of the wrong <code>x</code>. 
The other one will likely return zero if <code>x</code> exists, and an error
otherwise.

   <p>This is because in both cases, the first argument is evaluated in the
calling environment first.  The result (which should be an object of
mode <code>"expression"</code> or <code>"call"</code>) is then evaluated or
differentiated.  What you (most likely) really want is obtained by
&ldquo;quoting&rdquo; the first argument upon surrounding it with
<code>expression()</code>.  For example,

<pre class="example">     R&gt; D(expression(x^2), "x")
     2 * x
</pre>
   <p>Although this behavior may initially seem to be rather strange, is
perfectly logical.  The &ldquo;intuitive&rdquo; behavior could easily be
implemented, but problems would arise whenever the expression is
contained in a variable, passed as a parameter, or is the result of a
function call.  Consider for instance the semantics in cases like

<pre class="example">     D2 &lt;- function(e, n) D(D(e, n), n)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or

<pre class="example">     g &lt;- function(y) eval(substitute(y), sys.frame(sys.parent(n = 2)))
     g(a * b)
</pre>
   <p>See the help page for <code>deriv()</code> for more examples.

<h3 class="section">7.5 Why do my matrices lose dimensions?</h3>

<p>When a matrix with a single row or column is created by a subscripting
operation, e.g., <code>row &lt;- mat[2, ]</code>, it is by default turned into a
vector.  In a similar way if an array with dimension, say, 2&nbsp;x&nbsp;3&nbsp;x&nbsp;1&nbsp;x&nbsp;4<!-- /@w --> is created by subscripting it will be coerced into a 2&nbsp;x&nbsp;3&nbsp;x&nbsp;4<!-- /@w -->
array, losing the unnecessary dimension.  After much discussion this has
been determined to be a <em>feature</em>.

   <p>To prevent this happening, add the option <span class="option">drop = FALSE</span> to the
subscripting.  For example,

<pre class="example">     rowmatrix &lt;- mat[2, , drop = FALSE]  # <span class="roman">creates a row matrix</span>
     colmatrix &lt;- mat[, 2, drop = FALSE]  # <span class="roman">creates a column matrix</span>
     a &lt;- b[1, 1, 1, drop = FALSE]        # <span class="roman">creates a 1 x 1 x 1 array</span>
</pre>
   <p>The <span class="option">drop = FALSE</span> option should be used defensively when
programming.  For example, the statement

<pre class="example">     somerows &lt;- mat[index, ]
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will return a vector rather than a matrix if <code>index</code> happens to
have length 1, causing errors later in the code.  It should probably be
rewritten as

<pre class="example">     somerows &lt;- mat[index, , drop = FALSE]
</pre>

<h3 class="section">7.6 How does autoloading work?</h3>

<p>R has a special environment called <code>.AutoloadEnv</code>.  Using
<kbd>autoload(</kbd><var>name</var><kbd>, </kbd><var>pkg</var><kbd>)</kbd>, where <var>name</var> and
<var>pkg</var> are strings giving the names of an object and the package
containing it, stores some information in this environment.  When R
tries to evaluate <var>name</var>, it loads the corresponding package
<var>pkg</var> and reevaluates <var>name</var> in the new package's
environment.

   <p>Using this mechanism makes R behave as if the package was loaded, but
does not occupy memory (yet).

   <p>See the help page for <code>autoload()</code> for a very nice example.

<h3 class="section">7.7 How should I set options?</h3>

<p>The function <code>options()</code> allows setting and examining a variety of
global &ldquo;options&rdquo; which affect the way in which R computes and displays
its results.  The variable <code>.Options</code> holds the current values of
these options, but should never directly be assigned to unless you want
to drive yourself crazy&mdash;simply pretend that it is a &ldquo;read-only&rdquo;
variable.

   <p>For example, given

<pre class="example">     test1 &lt;- function(x = pi, dig = 3) {
       oo &lt;- options(digits = dig); on.exit(options(oo));
       cat(.Options$digits, x, "\n")
     }
     test2 &lt;- function(x = pi, dig = 3) {
       .Options$digits &lt;- dig
       cat(.Options$digits, x, "\n")
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">we obtain:

<pre class="example">     R&gt; test1()
     3 3.14
     R&gt; test2()
     3 3.141593
</pre>
   <p>What is really used is the <em>global</em> value of <code>.Options</code>, and
using <kbd>options(OPT = VAL)</kbd> correctly updates it.  Local copies of
<code>.Options</code>, either in <code>.GlobalEnv</code> or in a function
environment (frame), are just silently disregarded.

<h3 class="section">7.8 How do file names work in Windows?</h3>

<p>As R uses C-style string handling, <span class="samp">\</span> is treated as an escape
character, so that for example one can enter a newline as <span class="samp">\n</span>. 
When you really need a <span class="samp">\</span>, you have to escape it with another
<span class="samp">\</span>.

   <p>Thus, in filenames use something like <code>"c:\\data\\money.dat"</code>.  You
can also replace <span class="samp">\</span> by <span class="samp">/</span> (<code>"c:/data/money.dat"</code>).

<h3 class="section">7.9 Why does plotting give a color allocation error?</h3>

<p>On an X11 device, plotting sometimes, e.g., when running
<code>demo("image")</code>, results in &ldquo;Error: color allocation error&rdquo;. 
This is an X problem, and only indirectly related to R.  It occurs when
applications started prior to R have used all the available colors. 
(How many colors are available depends on the X configuration; sometimes
only 256 colors can be used.)

   <p>One application which is notorious for &ldquo;eating&rdquo; colors is Netscape. 
If the problem occurs when Netscape is running, try (re)starting it with
either the <span class="option">-no-install</span> (to use the default colormap) or the
<span class="option">-install</span> (to install a private colormap) option.

   <p>You could also set the <code>colortype</code> of <code>X11()</code> to
<code>"pseudo.cube"</code> rather than the default <code>"pseudo"</code>.  See the
help page for <code>X11()</code> for more information.

<h3 class="section">7.10 How do I convert factors to numeric?</h3>

<p>It may happen that when reading numeric data into R (usually, when
reading in a file), they come in as factors.  If <code>f</code> is such a
factor object, you can use

<pre class="example">     as.numeric(as.character(f))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">to get the numbers back.  More efficient, but harder to remember, is

<pre class="example">     as.numeric(levels(f))[as.integer(f)]
</pre>
   <p>In any case, do not call <code>as.numeric()</code> or their likes directly for
the task at hand (as <code>as.numeric()</code> or <code>unclass()</code> give the
internal codes).

<p>The recommended package <strong>lattice</strong> (which is based on another

that is compatible with most Trellis commands.

   <p>You could also look at <code>coplot()</code> and <code>dotchart()</code> which might
do at least some of what you want.  Note also that the R version of
<code>pairs()</code> is fairly general and provides most of the functionality
of <code>splom()</code>, and that R's default plot method has an argument
<code>asp</code> allowing to specify (and fix against device resizing) the
aspect ratio of the plot.

   <p>(Because the word &ldquo;Trellis&rdquo; has been claimed as a trademark we do not
use it in R.  The name &ldquo;lattice&rdquo; has been chosen for the R

<p>Inside a function you may want to access variables in two additional
environments: the one that the function was defined in (&ldquo;enclosing&rdquo;),
and the one it was invoked in (&ldquo;parent&rdquo;).

   <p>If you create a function at the command line or load it in a package its
enclosing environment is the global workspace.  If you define a function
<code>f()</code> inside another function <code>g()</code> its enclosing environment
is the environment inside <code>g()</code>.  The enclosing environment for a
function is fixed when the function is created.  You can find out the
enclosing environment for a function <code>f()</code> using
<code>environment(f)</code>.

   <p>The &ldquo;parent&rdquo; environment, on the other hand, is defined when you
invoke a function.  If you invoke <code>lm()</code> at the command line its
parent environment is the global workspace, if you invoke it inside a
function <code>f()</code> then its parent environment is the environment
inside <code>f()</code>.  You can find out the parent environment for an
invocation of a function by using <code>parent.frame()</code> or
<code>sys.frame(sys.parent())</code>.

   <p>So for most user-visible functions the enclosing environment will be the
global workspace, since that is where most functions are defined.  The
parent environment will be wherever the function happens to be called
from.  If a function <code>f()</code> is defined inside another function
<code>g()</code> it will probably be used inside <code>g()</code> as well, so its
parent environment and enclosing environment will probably be the same.

   <p>Parent environments are important because things like model formulas
need to be evaluated in the environment the function was called from,
since that's where all the variables will be available.  This relies on
the parent environment being potentially different with each invocation.

   <p>Enclosing environments are important because a function can use
variables in the enclosing environment to share information with other
functions or with other invocations of itself (see the section on
lexical scoping).  This relies on the enclosing environment being the
same each time the function is invoked.  (In C this would be done with
static variables.)

   <p>Scoping <em>is</em> hard.  Looking at examples helps.  It is particularly
instructive to look at examples that work differently in R and S and try
to see why they differ.  One way to describe the scoping differences
between R and S is to say that in S the enclosing environment is
<em>always</em> the global workspace, but in R the enclosing environment
is wherever the function was created.

<h3 class="section">7.13 How can I substitute into a plot label?</h3>

<p>Often, it is desired to use the value of an R object in a plot label,
e.g., a title.  This is easily accomplished using <code>paste()</code> if the
label is a simple character string, but not always obvious in case the
label is an expression (for refined mathematical annotation).  In such a
case, either use <code>parse()</code> on your pasted character string or use
<code>substitute()</code> on an expression.  For example, if <code>ahat</code> is an
estimator of your parameter a of interest, use

<pre class="example">     title(substitute(hat(a) == ahat, list(ahat = ahat)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(note that it is <span class="samp">==</span> and not <span class="samp">=</span>).  Sometimes <code>bquote()</code>
gives a more compact form, e.g.,

<pre class="example">     title(bquote(hat(a) = .(ahat)))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where subexpressions enclosed in <span class="samp">.()</span> are replaced by their
values.

   <p>There are more worked examples in the mailing list archives.

<h3 class="section">7.14 What are valid names?</h3>

<p>When creating data frames using <code>data.frame()</code> or
<code>read.table()</code>, R by default ensures that the variable names are
syntactically valid.  (The argument <span class="option">check.names</span> to these
functions controls whether variable names are checked and adjusted by
<code>make.names()</code> if needed.)

   <p>To understand what names are &ldquo;valid&rdquo;, one needs to take into account
that the term &ldquo;name&rdquo; is used in several different (but related) ways
in the language:

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>A <em>syntactic name</em> is a string the parser interprets as this type
of expression.  It consists of letters, numbers, and the dot and (for
version of R at least 1.9.0) underscore characters, and starts with
either a letter or a dot not followed by a number.  Reserved words are
not syntactic names. 
<li>An <em>object name</em> is a string associated with an object that is
assigned in an expression either by having the object name on the left
of an assignment operation or as an argument to the <code>assign()</code>
function.  It is usually a syntactic name as well, but can be any
non-empty string if it is quoted (and it is always quoted in the call to
<code>assign()</code>).

     <li>An <em>argument name</em> is what appears to the left of the equals sign
when supplying an argument in a function call (for example,
<code>f(trim=.5)</code>).  Argument names are also usually syntactic names,
but again can be anything if they are quoted.

     <li>An <em>element name</em> is a string that identifies a piece of an object
(a component of a list, for example.)  When it is used on the right of
the <span class="samp">$</span> operator, it must be a syntactic name, or quoted. 
Otherwise, element names can be any strings.  (When an object is used as
a database, as in a call to <code>eval()</code> or <code>attach()</code>, the
element names become object names.)

     <li>Finally, a <em>file name</em> is a string identifying a file in the
operating system for reading, writing, etc.  It really has nothing much
to do with names in the language, but it is traditional to call these
strings file &ldquo;names&rdquo;.
        </ol>

<p>Package <strong>gam</strong> from <acronym>CRAN</acronym> implements all the Generalized
Additive Models (GAM) functionality as described in the GAM chapter of
the White Book.  In particular, it implements backfitting with both
local regression and smoothing splines, and is extendable.  There is a
<code>gam()</code> function for GAMs in package <strong>mgcv</strong>, but it is not
an exact clone of what is described in the White Book (no <code>lo()</code>

if you can accept regression splines you can use <code>glm()</code>.  For
Gaussian GAMs you can use <code>bruto()</code> from package <strong>mda</strong>.

<h3 class="section">7.17 Why does outer() behave strangely with my function?</h3>

<p>As the help for <code>outer()</code> indicates, it does not work on arbitrary
functions the way the <code>apply()</code> family does.  It requires functions
that are vectorized to work elementwise on arrays.  As you can see by
looking at the code, <code>outer(x, y, FUN)</code> creates two large vectors
containing every possible combination of elements of <code>x</code> and
<code>y</code> and then passes this to <code>FUN</code> all at once.  Your function
probably cannot handle two large vectors as parameters.

   <p>If you have a function that cannot handle two vectors but can handle two
scalars, then you can still use <code>outer()</code> but you will need to wrap
your function up first, to simulate vectorized behavior.  Suppose your
function is

<pre class="example">     foo &lt;- function(x, y, happy) {
       stopifnot(length(x) == 1, length(y) == 1) # scalars only!
       (x + y) * happy
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If you define the general function

<pre class="example">     wrapper &lt;- function(x, y, my.fun, ...) {
       sapply(seq(along = x), FUN = function(i) my.fun(x[i], y[i], ...))
     }
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">then you can use <code>outer()</code> by writing, e.g.,

<pre class="example">     outer(1:4, 1:2, FUN = wrapper, my.fun = foo, happy = 10)

<h3 class="section">7.18 Why does the output from anova() depend on the order of factors in the model?</h3>

<p>In a model such as <code>~A+B+A:B</code>, R will report the difference in sums
of squares between the models <code>~1</code>, <code>~A</code>, <code>~A+B</code> and
<code>~A+B+A:B</code>.  If the model were <code>~B+A+A:B</code>, R would report
differences between <code>~1</code>, <code>~B</code>, <code>~A+B</code>, and
<code>~A+B+A:B</code> . In the first case the sum of squares for <code>A</code> is
comparing <code>~1</code> and <code>~A</code>, in the second case it is comparing
<code>~B</code> and <code>~B+A</code>.  In a non-orthogonal design (i.e., most
unbalanced designs) these comparisons are (conceptually and numerically)
different.

   <p>Some packages report instead the sums of squares based on comparing the
full model to the models with each factor removed one at a time (the
famous `Type III sums of squares' from SAS, for example).  These do not
depend on the order of factors in the model.  The question of which set
of sums of squares is the Right Thing provokes low-level holy wars on
R-help from time to time.

   <p>There is no need to be agitated about the particular sums of squares
that R reports.  You can compute your favorite sums of squares quite
easily.  Any two models can be compared with <code>anova(</code><var>model1</var><code>,
</code><var>model2</var><code>)</code>, and <code>drop1(</code><var>model1</var><code>)</code> will show the sums of
squares resulting from dropping single terms.

<h3 class="section">7.19 How do I produce PNG graphics in batch mode?</h3>

<p>Under a Unix-alike, if your installation supports the
<code>type="cairo"</code> option to the <code>png()</code> device there should be no
problems, and the default settings should just work.  This option is not
available for versions of R prior to 2.7.0, or without support for
cairo.  From R 2.7.0 <code>png()</code> by default uses the Quartz device
on Mac OS X, and that too works in batch mode.

   <p>Earlier versions of the <code>png()</code> device uses the X11 driver, which is
a problem in batch mode or for remote operation.  If you have Ghostscript
you can use <code>bitmap()</code>, which produces a PostScript or PDF file then
converts it to any bitmap format supported by Ghostscript.  On some
installations this produces ugly output, on others it is perfectly
satisfactory.  Many systems now come with Xvfb from
<a href="http://www.x.org/Downloads.html">X.Org</a> (possibly as an optional
install), which is an X11 server that does not require a screen; and there
is the <strong>GDD</strong> package from <acronym>CRAN</acronym>, which produces PNG, JPEG and GIF
bitmaps without X11.

<h3 class="section">7.28 Why is read.table() so inefficient?</h3>

<p>By default, <code>read.table()</code> needs to read in everything as character
data, and then try to figure out which variables to convert to numerics
or factors.  For a large data set, this takes considerable amounts of
time and memory.  Performance can substantially be improved by using the
<code>colClasses</code> argument to specify the classes to be assumed for the
columns of the table.

<h3 class="section">7.29 What is the difference between package and library?</h3>

<p>A <dfn>package</dfn> is a standardized collection of material extending R,
e.g. providing code, data, or documentation.  A <dfn>library</dfn> is a
place (directory) where R knows to find packages it can use (i.e., which
were <dfn>installed</dfn>).  R is told to use a package (to &ldquo;load&rdquo; it and
add it to the search path) via calls to the function <code>library</code>. 
I.e., <code>library()</code> is employed to load a package from libraries
containing packages.

<h3 class="section">7.31 Why doesn't R think these numbers are equal?</h3>

<p>The only numbers that can be represented exactly in R's numeric type
are integers and fractions whose denominator is a power of 2.  Other
numbers have to be rounded to (typically) 53 binary digits accuracy.  As a
result, two floating point numbers will not reliably be equal unless they
have been computed by the same algorithm, and not always even then.  For
example

<pre class="example">     R&gt; a &lt;- sqrt(2)
     R&gt; a * a == 2
     [1] FALSE
     R&gt; a * a - 2
     [1] 4.440892e-16
</pre>
   <p>The function <code>all.equal()</code> compares two objects using a numeric
tolerance of <code>.Machine$double.eps ^ 0.5</code>.  If you want much greater
accuracy than this you will need to consider error propagation
carefully.

Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic&rdquo;,

<h3 class="section">7.36 Why are there unwanted borders, lines or grid-like artifacts when viewing a plot saved to a PS or PDF file?</h3>

<p>This can occur when using functions such as <code>polygon()</code>,

call these internally.  In the case of <code>polygon()</code>, you may observe
unwanted borders between the polygons even when setting the

   <p>The source of the problem is the PS/PDF viewer when the plot is

upon the viewer used, the operating system and may change over time.

<h3 class="section">7.37 Why does backslash behave strangely inside strings?</h3>

<p>This question most often comes up in relation to file names (see
<a href="#How-do-file-names-work-in-Windows_003f">How do file names work in Windows?</a>)  but it also happens that
people complain that they cannot seem to put a single <span class="samp">\</span> character
into a text string unless it happens to be followed by certain other
characters.

   <p>To understand this, you have to distinguish between character strings
and <em>representations</em> of character strings.  Mostly, the
representation in R is just the string with a single or double quote at
either end, but there are strings that cannot be represented that way,
e.g., strings that themselves contains the quote character.  So

<pre class="example">     &gt; str &lt;- "This \"text\" is quoted"
     &gt; str
     [1] "This \"text\" is quoted"
     &gt; cat(str, "\n")
     This "text" is quoted
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">The <em>escape sequences</em> <span class="samp">\"</span> and <span class="samp">\n</span> represent a double
quote and the newline character respectively. Printing text strings,
using <code>print()</code> or by typing the name at the prompt will use the
escape sequences too, but the <code>cat()</code> function will display the
string as-is. Notice that <span class="samp">"\n"</span> is a one-character string, not
two; the backslash is not actually in the string, it is just generated
in the printed representation.

<pre class="example">     &gt; nchar("\n")
     [1] 1
     &gt; substring("\n", 1, 1)
     [1] "\n"
</pre>
   <p>So how do you put a backslash in a string? For this, you have to
escape the escape character. I.e., you have to double the backslash. 
as in

<pre class="example">     &gt; cat("\\n", "\n")
     \n
</pre>
   <p>Some functions, particularly those involving regular expression
matching, themselves use metacharacters, which may need to be escaped by
the backslash mechanism.  In those cases you may need a <em>quadruple</em>
backslash to represent a single literal one.

   <p>In versions of R up to 2.4.1 an unknown escape sequence like <span class="samp">\p</span>
was quietly interpreted as just <span class="samp">p</span>.  Current versions of R emit a
warning.

<p>Suppose you want to provide a summary method for class <code>"foo"</code>. 
Then <code>summary.foo()</code> should not print anything, but return an
object of class <code>"summary.foo"</code>, <em>and</em> you should write a
method <code>print.summary.foo()</code> which nicely prints the summary
information and invisibly returns its object.  This approach is
preferred over having <code>summary.foo()</code> print summary information and
return something useful, as sometimes you need to grab something
computed by <code>summary()</code> inside a function or similar.  In such
cases you don't want anything printed.

<h3 class="section">9.1 What is a bug?</h3>

<p>If R executes an illegal instruction, or dies with an operating system
error message that indicates a problem in the program (as opposed to
something like &ldquo;disk full&rdquo;), then it is certainly a bug.  If you call
<code>.C()</code>, <code>.Fortran()</code>, <code>.External()</code> or <code>.Call()</code> (or
<code>.Internal()</code>) yourself (or in a function you wrote), you can
always crash R by using wrong argument types (modes).  This is not a
bug.

   <p>Taking forever to complete a command can be a bug, but you must make
certain that it was really R's fault.  Some commands simply take a long
time.  If the input was such that you <em>know</em> it should have been
processed quickly, report a bug.  If you don't know whether the command
should take a long time, find out by looking in the manual or by asking
for assistance.

   <p>If a command you are familiar with causes an R error message in a case
where its usual definition ought to be reasonable, it is probably a bug. 
If a command does the wrong thing, that is a bug.  But be sure you know
for certain what it ought to have done.  If you aren't familiar with the
command, or don't know for certain how the command is supposed to work,
then it might actually be working right.  For example, people sometimes
think there is a bug in R's mathematics because they don't understand
how finite-precision arithmetic works.  Rather than jumping to
conclusions, show the problem to someone who knows for certain. 
Unexpected results of comparison of decimal numbers, for example
<code>0.28 * 100 != 28</code> or <code>0.1 + 0.2 != 0.3</code>, are not a bug. 
See <a href="#Why-doesn_0027t-R-think-these-numbers-are-equal_003f">Why doesn't R think these numbers are equal?</a>, for more details.

   <p>Finally, a command's intended definition may not be best for statistical
analysis.  This is a very important sort of problem, but it is also a
matter of judgment.  Also, it is easy to come to such a conclusion out
of ignorance of some of the existing features.  It is probably best not
to complain about such a problem until you have checked the
documentation in the usual ways, feel confident that you understand it,
and know for certain that what you want is not available.  If you are
not sure what the command is supposed to do after a careful reading of
the manual this indicates a bug in the manual.  The manual's job is to
make everything clear.  It is just as important to report documentation
bugs as program bugs.  However, we know that the introductory
documentation is seriously inadequate, so you don't need to report this.

   <p>If the online argument list of a function disagrees with the manual, one
of them must be wrong, so report the bug.

<h3 class="section">9.2 How to report a bug</h3>

<p>When you decide that there is a bug, it is important to report it and to
report it in a way which is useful.  What is most useful is an exact
description of what commands you type, starting with the shell command
to run R, until the problem happens.  Always include the version of R,
machine, and operating system that you are using; type <kbd>version</kbd> in
R to print this.

   <p>The most important principle in reporting a bug is to report
<em>facts</em>, not hypotheses or categorizations.  It is always easier to
report the facts, but people seem to prefer to strain to posit
explanations and report them instead.  If the explanations are based on
guesses about how R is implemented, they will be useless; others will
have to try to figure out what the facts must have been to lead to such
speculations.  Sometimes this is impossible.  But in any case, it is
unnecessary work for the ones trying to fix the problem.

   <p>For example, suppose that on a data set which you know to be quite large
the command

<pre class="example">     R&gt; data.frame(x, y, z, monday, tuesday)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">never returns.  Do not report that <code>data.frame()</code> fails for large
data sets.  Perhaps it fails when a variable name is a day of the week. 
If this is so then when others got your report they would try out the
<code>data.frame()</code> command on a large data set, probably with no day of
the week variable name, and not see any problem.  There is no way in the
world that others could guess that they should try a day of the week
variable name.

   <p>Or perhaps the command fails because the last command you used was a
method for <code>"["()</code> that had a bug causing R's internal data
structures to be corrupted and making the <code>data.frame()</code> command
fail from then on.  This is why others need to know what other commands
you have typed (or read from your startup file).

   <p>It is very useful to try and find simple examples that produce
apparently the same bug, and somewhat useful to find simple examples
that might be expected to produce the bug but actually do not.  If you
want to debug the problem and find exactly what caused it, that is
wonderful.  You should still report the facts as well as any
explanations or solutions.  Please include an example that reproduces
(e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility</a>) the problem,
preferably the simplest one you have found.

   <p>Invoking R with the <span class="option">--vanilla</span> option may help in isolating a
bug.  This ensures that the site profile and saved data files are not
read.

   <p>Before you actually submit a bug report, you should check whether the
bug has already been reported and/or fixed.  First, try the &ldquo;Search
Existing Reports&rdquo; facility in the Bug Tracking page at
<a href="http://bugs.R-project.org/">http://bugs.R-project.org/</a>.  Second, consult
<a href="https://svn.R-project.org/R/trunk/NEWS">https://svn.R-project.org/R/trunk/NEWS</a>, which records changes that
will appear in the <em>next</em> release of R, including some bug fixes
that do not appear in Bug Tracking.  (Windows users should additionally
consult
<a href="https://svn.R-project.org/R/trunk/src/gnuwin32/CHANGES">https://svn.R-project.org/R/trunk/src/gnuwin32/CHANGES</a>.) 
Third, if possible try the current r-patched or r-devel version of R. 
If a bug has already been reported or fixed, please do not submit
further bug reports on it.  Finally, check carefully whether the bug is
with R, or a contributed package.  Bug reports on contributed packages
should be sent first to the package maintainer, and only submitted to
the R-bugs repository by package maintainers, mentioning the package in
the subject line.

   <p>On Unix systems a bug report can be generated using the function
<code>bug.report()</code>.  This automatically includes the version
information and sends the bug to the correct address.  Alternatively the
bug report can be emailed to <a href="mailto:R-bugs@R-project.org">R-bugs@R-project.org</a> or submitted
to the Web page at <a href="http://bugs.R-project.org/">http://bugs.R-project.org/</a>.  Please try
including results of <code>sessionInfo()</code> in your bug report.

   <p>There is a section of the bug repository for suggestions for
enhancements for R labelled <span class="samp">wishlist</span>.  Suggestions can be
submitted in the same ways as bugs, but please ensure that the subject
line makes clear that this is for the wishlist and not a bug report, for
example by starting with <span class="samp">Wishlist:</span>.

   <p>Comments on and suggestions for the Windows port of R should be sent to
<a href="mailto:R-windows@R-project.org">R-windows@R-project.org</a>.

   <p>Corrections to and comments on message translation should be sent to the
last translator (listed at the top of the appropriate <span class="samp">.po</span> file)
or to the translation team as listed at
<a href="http://developer.R-project.org/TranslationTeams.html">http://developer.R-project.org/TranslationTeams.html</a>.
