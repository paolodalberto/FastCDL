1 Obtaining R
*************

Sources, binaries and documentation for R can be obtained via CRAN, the
"Comprehensive R Archive Network" whose current members are listed at
`http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html'.

* Menu:

* Getting and unpacking the sources::
* Getting patched and development versions::


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Getting and unpacking the sources,  Next: Getting patched and development versions,  Prev: Obtaining R,  Up: Obtaining R

1.1 Getting and unpacking the sources
=====================================

The simplest way is to download the most recent `R-X.Y.Z.tar.gz' file,
and unpack it with

     tar xf R-X.Y.Z.tar.gz

on systems that have a suitable(1) `tar' installed.  On other systems
you need to have the `gzip' program installed, when you can use

     gzip -dc R-X.Y.Z.tar.gz | tar xf -

   The pathname of the directory into which the sources are unpacked
should not contain spaces, as `make' (specifically GNU `make' 3.81)
does not expect spaces.

   If you want the build to be usable by a group of users, set `umask'
before unpacking so that the files will be readable by the target group
(e.g., `umask 022' to be usable by all users).  (Keep this setting of
`umask' whilst building and installing.)

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) GNU `tar' version 1.15 or later, or that from the `libarchive'
(as used on Mac OS 10.6) or `Heirloom Toolchest' distributions.


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Getting patched and development versions,  Prev: Getting and unpacking the sources,  Up: Obtaining R

1.2 Getting patched and development versions
============================================

A patched version of the current release, `r-patched', and the current
development version, `r-devel', are available as daily tarballs and via
access to the R Subversion repository.  (For the two weeks prior to the
release of a minor (2.x.0) version, `r-patched' will refer to
beta/release candidates of the upcoming release, the patched version of
the current release being available only via Subversion.)

   The tarballs are available from
`ftp://ftp.stat.math.ethz.ch/pub/Software/R/'.  Download either
`R-patched.tar.gz' or `R-devel.tar.gz' (or the `.tar.bz2' versions) and
unpack as described in the previous section.  They are built in exactly
the same way as distributions of R releases.

* Using Subversion and rsync::


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Using Subversion and rsync,  Prev: Getting patched and development versions,  Up: Getting patched and development versions

1.2.1 Using Subversion and rsync
--------------------------------

Sources are also available via `https://svn.R-project.org/R/', the R
Subversion repository.  If you have a Subversion client (see
`http://subversion.tigris.org/'), you can check out and update the
current r-devel from `https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/' and the
current r-patched from
`https://svn.r-project.org/R/branches/R-X-Y-branch/' (where X and Y are
the major and minor number of the current released version of R).
E.g., use

     svn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/ PATH

to check out `r-devel' into directory PATH.  The alpha, beta and RC
versions of an upcoming X.Y.0 release are available from
`https://svn.r-project.org/R/branches/R-X-Y-branch/' in the four-week
period prior to the release.

   Note that `https:' is required, and that the SSL certificate for the
Subversion server of the R project is

     Certificate information:
      - Hostname: svn.r-project.org
      - Valid: from Jul 16 08:10:01 2004 GMT until Jul 14 08:10:01 2014 GMT
      - Issuer: Department of Mathematics, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland, CH
      - Fingerprint: c9:5d:eb:f9:f2:56:d1:04:ba:44:61:f8:64:6b:d9:33:3f:93:6e:ad

(currently, there is no "trusted certificate").  You can accept this
certificate permanently and will not be asked about it anymore.

   Note that retrieving the sources by e.g. `wget -r' or `svn export'
from that URL will not work: the Subversion information is needed to
build R.

   The Subversion repository does not contain the current sources for
the recommended packages, which can be obtained by `rsync' or
downloaded from CRAN.  To use `rsync' to install the appropriate
sources for the recommended packages, run `./tools/rsync-recommended'
from the top-level of the R sources.

   If downloading manually from CRAN, do ensure that you have the
correct versions of the recommended packages: if the number in the file
`VERSION' is `X.Y.Z' you need to download the contents of
`http://CRAN.R-project.org/src/contrib/DIR', where DIR is
`X.Y.Z/Recommended' for r-devel or `X.Y-patched/Recommended' for
r-patched, respectively, to directory `src/library/Recommended' in the
sources you have unpacked.  After downloading manually you need to
execute `tools/link-recommended' from the top level of the sources to
make the requisite links in `src/library/Recommended'.  A suitable
incantation from the top level of the R sources using `wget' might be

     wget -r -l1 --no-parent -A\*.gz -nd -P src/library/Recommended \
       http://CRAN.R-project.org/src/contrib/DIR
     ./tools/link-recommended

2 Installing R under Unix-alikes
********************************

R will configure and build under a number of common Unix and Unix-alike
platforms including `CPU-*-linux-gnu' for the `alpha', `arm', `hppa',
`ix86', `ia64', `m68k', `mips', `mipsel', `powerpc', `s390', `sparc',
and `x86_64' CPUs, `powerpc-apple-darwin', `i386-apple-darwin',
`x86_64-apple-darwin', `i386-sun-solaris', `sparc-sun-solaris',
`x86_64-*-freebsd', and `powerpc-ibm-aix6*' as well as perhaps (it is
tested less frequently on these platforms) `i386-*-freebsd',
`i386-*-netbsd' and `i386-*-openbsd'.

   In addition, binary distributions are available for some common Linux
distributions and for Mac OS X.  See the FAQ for current details.
These are installed in platform-specific ways, so for the rest of this
chapter we consider only building from the sources.

File: R-admin.info,  Node: Simple compilation,  Next: Help options,  Prev: Installing R under Unix-alikes,  Up: Installing R under Unix-alikes

2.1 Simple compilation
======================

First review the essential and useful tools and libraries in *Note
Essential and useful other programs under Unix::, and install those you want
or need.  Ensure that the environment variable `TMPDIR' is either unset
(and `/tmp' exists and can be written in and scripts can be executed
from) or points to a valid temporary directory (one from which
execution of scripts is allowed).

   Choose a place to install the R tree (R is not just a binary, but
has additional data sets, help files, font metrics etc).  Let us call
this place R_HOME.  Untar the source code.  This should create
directories `src', `doc', and several more under a top-level directory:
change to that top-level directory (At this point North American
readers should consult *Note Setting paper size::.)  Issue the
following commands:

     ./configure
     make

(See *Note Using make:: if your make is not called `make'.)

   Then check the built system works correctly by

     make check

Failures are not necessarily problems as they might be caused by missing
functionality,(1) but you should look carefully at any reported
discrepancies.  (Some non-fatal errors are expected in locales that do
not support Latin-1, in particular in true `C' locales and non-UTF-8
non-Western-European locales.)  A failure in `tests/ok-errors.R' may
indicate inadequate resource limits (*note Running R::).

   More comprehensive testing can be done by

     make check-devel

or

     make check-all

see `tests/README'.

   If the command `configure' and `make' commands execute successfully,
a shell-script front-end called `R' will be created and copied to
`R_HOME/bin'.  You can copy this script to a place where users can
invoke it, for example to `/usr/local/bin/R'.  You could also copy the
man page `R.1' to a place where your `man' reader finds it, such as
`/usr/local/man/man1'.  If you want to install the complete R tree to,
e.g., `/usr/local/lib/R', see *Note Installation::.  Note: you do not
_need_ to install R: you can run it from where it was built.

   You do not necessarily have to build R in the top-level source
directory (say, `TOP_SRCDIR').  To build in `BUILDDIR', run

     cd BUILDDIR
     TOP_SRCDIR/configure
     make

and so on, as described further below.  This has the advantage of
always keeping your source tree "clean" and is particularly recommended
when you work with a version of R from Subversion.  (You may need GNU
`make' to allow this, and the pathname of the build directory should
not contain spaces.)

   For those obtaining R _via_ Subversion, one additional step is
necessary: 

     make vignettes

which makes the *grid* vignettes (which are contained in the tarballs):
it make take several minutes.

   Now `rehash' if necessary, type `R', and read the R manuals and the
R FAQ (files `FAQ' or `doc/manual/R-FAQ.html', or
`http://CRAN.R-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html' which always has the
version for the latest release of R).

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) for example, if you configured R with `--without-recommended'.


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Help options,  Next: Making the manuals,  Prev: Simple compilation,  Up: Installing R under Unix-alikes

2.2 Help options
================

As from R 2.10.0, by default HTML help pages are created when needed
rather than being built at install time.

   If you need to disable the server and want HTML help, there is the
option to continue to build HTML pages at when packages are installed
(including those installed with R).  This is enabled by the `configure'
option `--enable-prebuilt-html'.  Whether `R CMD INSTALL' (and hence
`install.packages') pre-builds HTML pages is determined by looking at
the R installation and is reported by `R CMD INSTALL --help': it can be
overridden by specifying the one of the `INSTALL' options `--html' or
`-no-html'.

   The server is disabled by setting the environment variable `R_DISABLE_HTTPD'
to a non-empty value, either before R is started or within the R
session before HTML help (including `help.start') is used.  It is also
possible that system security measures will prevent the server from
being started, for example if the loopback interface has been disabled.
The `"help.ports"' option can be set to control the port used by the
server.


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Making the manuals,  Next: Installation,  Prev: Help options,  Up: Installing R under Unix-alikes

2.3 Making the manuals
======================

There is a set of manuals that can be built from the sources,

`refman'
     Printed versions of the help pages for the most commonly used
     packages.

`fullrefman'
     Printed versions of all the help pages.

`R-FAQ'
     R FAQ

`R-intro'
     "An Introduction to R".

`R-data'
     "R Data Import/Export".

`R-admin'
     "R Installation and Administration", this manual.

`R-exts'
     "Writing R Extensions".

`R-lang'
     "The R Language Definition".

To make these (except `fullrefman'), use

     make dvi      to create DVI versions
     make pdf      to create PDF versions
     make info     to create info files (not `refman').

   You will not be able to build any of these unless you have
`makeinfo' version 4.7 or later installed, and for DVI or PDF you must
have `texi2dvi' and `texinfo.tex' installed (which are part of the GNU
*texinfo* distribution but are, especially `texinfo.tex', often made
part of the TeX package in re-distributions).

   The DVI versions can be previewed and printed using standard programs
such as `xdvi' and `dvips'.  The PDF versions can be viewed using any
recent PDF viewer: they have hyperlinks that can be followed.  The info
files are suitable for reading online with Emacs or the standalone GNU
`info' program.  The DVI and PDF versions will be created using the
papersize selected at configuration (default ISO a4): this can be
overridden by setting `R_PAPERSIZE' on the `make' command line, or
setting `R_PAPERSIZE' in the environment and using `make -e'.  (If
re-making the manuals for a different papersize, you should first
delete the file `doc/manual/version.texi'.)

   There are some issues with making the reference manual, and in
particular with the PDF version `refman.pdf'.  The help files contain
both ISO Latin1 characters (e.g. in `text.Rd') and upright quotes,
neither of which are contained in the standard LaTeX Computer Modern
fonts.  We have provided four alternatives:

`times'
     (The default for PDF.) Using standard PostScript fonts.  This works
     well both for on-screen viewing and for printing.  The one
     disadvantage is that the Usage and Examples sections may come out
     rather wide.

`lm'
     Using the _Latin Modern_ fonts.  These are not often installed as
     part of a TeX distribution, but can obtained from
     `http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/ps-type1/lm/' and mirrors.
     This uses fonts rather similar to Computer Modern, but is not so
     good on-screen as `times'.

`cm-super'
     Using type-1 versions of the Computer Modern fonts by Vladimir
     Volovich.  This is a large installation, obtainable from
     `http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/ps-type1/cm-super/' and its
     mirrors.  These type-1 fonts have poor hinting and so are nowhere
     near so readable on-screen as the other three options.

`ae'
     (The default for DVI.)  A package to use composites of Computer
     Modern fonts.  This works well most of the time, and its PDF is
     more readable on-screen than the previous two options.  There are
     three fonts for which it will need to use bitmapped fonts,
     `tctt0900.600pk', `tctt1000.600pk' and `tcrm1000.600pk'.
     Unfortunately, if those files are not available, Acrobat Reader
     will substitute completely incorrect glyphs so you need to examine
     the logs carefully.

   The default can be overridden by setting the environment variables `R_RD4PDF'
and `R_RD4DVI'.  (On Unix, these will be picked up at install time.)
The default value for `R_RD4PDF' is `times,hyper': omit `hyper' if you
do not want hyperlinks, e.g. for printing.  The default for `R_RD4DVI'
is `ae'.


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Installation,  Next: Uninstallation,  Prev: Making the manuals,  Up: Installing R under Unix-alikes

2.4 Installation
================

To ensure that the installed tree is usable by the right group of users,
set `umask' appropriately (perhaps to `022') before unpacking the
sources and throughout the build process.

   After

     ./configure
     make
     make check

(or, when building outside the source, `TOP_SRCDIR/configure', etc)
have been completed successfully, you can install the complete R tree
to your system by typing

     make install

This will install to the following directories:

`PREFIX/bin' or `BINDIR'
     the front-end shell script and other scripts and executables

`PREFIX/man/man1' or `MANDIR/man1'
     the man page

`PREFIX/LIBNN/R' or `LIBDIR/R'
     all the rest (libraries, on-line help system, ...).  Here LIBNN is
     usually `lib', but may be `lib64' on some 64-bit Linux systems.
     This is known as the R home directory.

where PREFIX is determined during configuration (typically
`/usr/local') and can be set by running `configure' with the option
`--prefix', as in

     ./configure --prefix=/where/you/want/R/to/go

This causes `make install' to install the R executable to
`/where/you/want/R/to/go/bin', and so on.  The prefix of the
installation directories can be seen in the status message that is
displayed at the end of `configure'.  You can install into another
directory tree by using

     make prefix=/path/to/here install

at least with GNU `make' (but not e.g. Solaris 8's `make').

   More precise control is available at configure time via options: see
`configure --help' for details.  (However, most of the `Fine tuning of
the installation directories' options are not used by R.)

   Configure options `--bindir' and `--mandir' are supported and govern
where a copy of the `R' script and the `man' page are installed.

   The configure option `--libdir' controls where the main R files are
installed: the default is `EPREFIX/LIBNN', where EPREFIX is the prefix
used for installing architecture-dependent files, defaults to PREFIX,
and can be set via the configure option `--exec-prefix'.

   Each of `bindir', `mandir' and `libdir' can also be specified on the
`make install' command line (at least for GNU `make').

   The `configure' or `make' variables `rdocdir' and `rsharedir' can be
used to install the system-independent `doc' and `share' directories to
somewhere other than `libdir'.  The C header files can be installed to
the value of `rincludedir': note that as the headers are not installed
into a subdirectory you probably want something like
`rincludedir=/usr/local/include/R-2.10.1'.

   If you want the R home to be something other than `LIBDIR/R', use
`rhome': for example

     make install rhome=/usr/local/lib64/R-2.10.0

will use a version-specific R home on a Linux 64-bit system.

   If you have made R as a shared/dynamic library you can install it in
your system's library directory by

     make prefix=/path/to/here install-libR

where `prefix' is optional, and `libdir' will give more precise control.

     make install-strip

will install stripped executables, and on platforms where this is
supported, stripped libraries in directories `lib' and `modules' and in
the standard packages.

   To install DVI, info and PDF versions of the manuals, use one or
more of

     make install-dvi
     make install-info
     make install-pdf

Once again, it is optional to specify `prefix', `libdir' or `rhome'
(the DVI and PDF manuals are installed under the R home directory).
(`make install-info' needs Perl installed if there is no command
`install-info' on the system.)

   More precise control is possible.  For info, the setting used is
that of `infodir' (default `PREFIX/info', set by configure option
`--infodir').  The DVI and PDF files are installed into the R `doc'
tree, set by the `make' variable `rdocdir'.

   A staged installation is possible, that it is installing R into a
temporary directory in order to move the installed tree to its final
destination.  In this case `prefix' (and so on) should reflect the final
destination, and `DESTDIR' should be used: see
`http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/DESTDIR.html'.

   You can optionally install the run-time tests that are part of `make
check-all' by

     make install-tests

which populates a `tests' directory in the installation.


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Uninstallation,  Next: Sub-architectures,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Installing R under Unix-alikes

2.5 Uninstallation
==================

You can uninstall R by

     make uninstall

optionally specifying `prefix' etc in the same way as specified for
installation.

   This will also uninstall any installed manuals.  There are specific
targets to uninstall DVI, info and PDF manuals in `doc/manual/Makefile'.

   Target `uninstall-tests' will uninstall any installed tests, as well
as removing the directory `tests' containing the test results.


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Sub-architectures,  Next: Testing a Unix Installation,  Prev: Uninstallation,  Up: Installing R under Unix-alikes

2.6 Sub-architectures
=====================

Some platforms can support closely related builds of R which can share
all but the executables and dynamic objects.  Examples include builds
under Solaris for different chips (in particular, 32- and 64-bit
builds), 64- and 32- bit builds on `x86_64' Linux and different CPUs
(e.g. `ppc', `ppc64', `i386' and `x86_64') under Mac OS >= 10.4.

   R supports the idea of architecture-specific builds, specified by
adding `r_arch=NAME' to the `configure' line.  Here NAME can be
anything non-empty, and is used to name subdirectories of `lib', `etc',
`include' and `libs'.  Example names from other systems are the use of
`sparcv9' on Sparc Solaris and `32' by `gcc' on `x86_64' Linux.

   If you have two or more such builds you can install them over each
other (and for 32/64-bit builds on one architecture, one build can be
done without `r_arch').  The space savings can be considerable: on
`x86_64' Linux a basic install (without debugging symbols) took 63Mb,
and adding a 32-bit build added 6Mb.  If you have installed multiple
builds you can select which build to run by

     R --arch=NAME

and just running `R' will run the last build that was installed.

   `R CMD INSTALL' will detect if more than one build is installed and
try to install packages with the appropriate library objects for each.
This will not be done if the package has an executable `configure'
script or a `src/Makefile' file.  In such cases you can install for
extra builds by

     R --arch=NAME CMD INSTALL --libs-only PKG(S)

   If you want to mix sub-architectures compiled on different platforms
(for example `x86_64' Linux and `i686' Linux), it is wise to use
explicit names for each, and you may also need to set `libdir' to
ensure that they install into the same place.

   When sub-architectures are used the version of `Rscript' in e.g.
`/usr/bin' will be the last installed, but architecture-specific
versions will be available in e.g.  `/usr/lib64/R/bin/execR_ARCH'.
Normally all installed architectures will run on the platform so the
architecture of `Rscript' does not matter.

   When running post-install tests with sub-architectures, use

     R --arch=NAME CMD make check[-devel|all]

to select a sub-architecture to check.

* Multilib::


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Multilib,  Prev: Sub-architectures,  Up: Sub-architectures

2.6.1 Multilib
--------------

On Linux, there is an alternative mechanism for mixing 32-bit and
64-bit libraries known as _multilib_. If a Linux distribution supports
multilib, then parallel builds of R may be installed in the
sub-directories `lib' (32-bit) and `lib64' (64-bit).  The build to be
run may then be chosen using the `setarch' command. For example, a
32-bit build may be chosen by

     setarch i686 R

   The `setarch' command is only operational if both 32-bit and 64-bit
builds are installed. If there is only one installation of R, then this
will always be run regardless of the architecture specified by the
`setarch' command.

   There can be problems with installing packages on the non-native
architecture.  It is a good idea to run e.g. `setarch i686 R' for
sessions in which packages are to be installed, even if that is the only
version of R installed (since this tells the package installation code
the architecture needed).

   At present there is a potential problem with packages using Java, as
the post-install for a `i386' RPM on `x86_64' Linux reconfigures Java
and will find the `x86_64' Java.  If you know where a 32-bit Java is
installed you may be able to run (as root)

     export JAVA_HOME=<path to jre directory of 32-bit Java>
     setarch i686 R CMD javareconf

to get a suitable setting.

   When this mechanism is used, the version of `Rscript' in e.g.
`/usr/bin' will be the last installed, but an architecture-specific
version will be available in e.g. `/usr/lib64/R/bin'.  Normally all
installed architectures will run on the platform so the architecture of
`Rscript' does not matter.


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Testing a Unix Installation,  Prev: Sub-architectures,  Up: Installing R under Unix-alikes

2.7 Testing an Installation
===========================

Full testing is possible only if the test files have been installed with

     make install-tests

which populates a `tests' directory in the installation.

   If this has been done, two testing routes are available.  The first
is to move to the home directory of the R installation (as given by
`R.home()') and run

     cd tests
     ## followed by one of
     ../bin/R CMD make check
     ../bin/R CMD make check-devel
     ../bin/R CMD make check-all

and other useful targets are `test-BasePackages' and `test-Recommended'
to the run tests of the standard and recommended packages (if
installed) respectively.

   This re-runs all the tests relevant to the installed R (including for
example code in the package vignettes), but not for example the ones
checking the example code in the manuals nor making the standalone Rmath
library.  This can occasionally be useful when the operating environment
has been changed, for example by OS updates or by substituting the BLAS
(*note Shared BLAS::).

   Alternatively, the installed R can be run, preferably with
`--vanilla'.  Then

     library("tools")
     testInstalledBasic("both")
     testInstalledPackages("base")
     testInstalledPackages("recommended")

runs the basic tests and then all the tests on the standard and
recommended packages.  These tests can be run from anywhere: they write
their results in the `tests' folder of the R home directory.  They run
slightly fewer tests than the first approach: in particular they do not
test Internet access.

   It is possible to test the installed packages (but not the
package-specific tests) by `testInstalledPackages' even if `make
install-tests' was not run.

3 Installing R under Windows
****************************

The `bin/windows' directory of a CRAN site contains binaries for a base
distribution and a large number of add-on packages from CRAN to run on
Windows 2000 or later on ix86 CPUs (including AMD64/EM64T chips and
Windows x64).

   Your file system must allow long file names (as is likely except
perhaps for some network-mounted systems).

   Installation is _via_ the installer `R-2.10.1-win32.exe'.  Just
double-click on the icon and follow the instructions.  You can
uninstall R from the Control Panel or from the (optional) R program
group on the Start Menu.

   Note that you will probably (depending on the Windows language
settings) be asked to choose a language for installation, and that
choice applies to both installation and un-installation but not to
running R itself.

   See the R Windows FAQ
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html) for more
details on the binary installer.

3.1.1 Getting the tools
-----------------------

If you want to build R from the sources, you will first need to
collect, install and test an extensive set of tools.  See *Note The
Windows toolset:: (and perhaps updates in
`http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/') for details.

   The `Rtools.exe' executable installer described in *Note The Windows
toolset:: also includes some source files in addition to the R source
as noted below. You should run it first, to obtain a working `tar' and
other necessities.  Choose a "Full installation", and install the extra
files into your intended R source directory, e.g.  `C:/R'. The
directory name _should not contain spaces_. We will call this directory
R_HOME below.


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Getting the source files,  Next: Building the core files,  Prev: Getting the tools,  Up: Building from source

3.1.2 Getting the source files
------------------------------

You need to collect the following sets of files:
   * Get the R source code `R-2.10.1.tar.gz' from CRAN.  Open a command
     window (or another shell) at directory R_HOME, and run

          tar xf R-2.10.1.tar.gz

     to create the source tree in R_HOME.  *Beware*: do use `tar' to
     extract the sources rather than tools such as WinZip that do not
     understand symbolic links.

     It is also possible to obtain the source code using Subversion; see
     *Note Obtaining R:: for details.

   * If you are not using a tarball you need to obtain copies of the
     recommended packages from CRAN.  Put the `.tar.gz' files in
     `R_HOME/src/library/Recommended' and run `make link-recommended'.
     If you have an Internet connection, you can do this automatically
     using

          make rsync-recommended

   * Optionally, you can install a version of ATLAS
     (`http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/') tuned to your system for
     fast linear algebra routines. Pre-built `Rblas.dll' for various
     CPUs are available in the `windows/contrib/ATLAS' area on CRAN.
     If you are building R from source, there are macros `USE_ATLAS'
     and `ATLAS_PATH' in the file `MkRules'.  Set `USE_ATLAS = YES' and
     `ATLAS_PATH' to where the ATLAS libraries are located.  You will
     need to make the libraries yourself(1): none of the binaries we
     have seen are compiled for the correct compiler.  Since R has its
     own `xerbla' it is necessary to delete that in ATLAS by

          ar d /path/to/libf77blas.a xerbla.o

     There used to be support for AMD's AMD Core Math Library (ACML) and
     Kazushige Goto's BLAS, but neither is currently available for use
     with the compilers used to compile R.


   The following additional items are normally installed by
`Rtools.exe'.  If instead you choose to do a completely manual build
you will also need

   * The Tcl/Tk support files are in a zip file at
     `http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/': unzip this in R_HOME, and
     it will add directory tree `R_HOME/Tcl'.

   * You need `libpng' and `jpeg' sources (available, e.g., from
     `http://www.libpng.org/', `http://www.ijg.org',
     `http://www.libtiff.org/')(2).  You will need files
     `libpng-1.2.18.tar.gz', `jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz', `tiff-3.8.0.tar.gz'
     or later.

     Working in the directory `R_HOME/src/gnuwin32/bitmap', install the
     `libpng' and `jpeg' sources in sub-directories.  The `jpeg'
     sub-directory for version 7 is named `jpeg-7'; if you use a
     different version (e.g. `jpeg-6b'), edit `src/gnuwin32/MkRules'
     and change the definition of `JPEGDIR': the names of the `libpng'
     and `libtiff' directories can also be set there.

     Example:

          > tar zxf libpng-1.2.40.tar.gz
          > mv libpng-1.2.40 libpng
          > tar zxf jpegsrc.v7.tar.gz
          > tar zxf tiff-3.9.1.tar.gz
          > mv tiff-3.9.1/libtiff .
          > rm -rf tiff-3.9.1


   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) We do this using the Cygwin compilers, often with some
difficulty.

   (2) but the current versions are at
`ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/pub/libtiff/': we used `tiff-3.9.1.tar.gz'


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Building the core files,  Next: Building the bitmap files,  Prev: Getting the source files,  Up: Building from source

3.1.3 Building the core files
-----------------------------

You may need to compile under a case-honouring file system: we found
that a `samba'-mounted file system (which maps all file names to lower
case) did not work.

   Open a command window at `R_HOME/src/gnuwin32'.  Edit `MkRules' to
set the appropriate paths as needed.  *Beware*: `MkRules' contains tabs
and some editors (e.g., WinEdt) silently remove them.  Then run

     make all recommended

and sit back and wait while the basic compile takes place.

   Notes:
   * We have had reports that earlier versions of anti-virus software
     locking up the machine, but not for several years.  However,
     aggressive anti-virus checking such as the on-access scanning of
     Sophos can slow the build down several-fold.

   * By default Doug Lea's `malloc' in the file
     `R_HOME/src/gnuwin32/malloc.c' is used for R's internal memory
     allocations.  You can opt out of this by commenting the line
     `LEA_MALLOC=YES' in `MkRules', in which case the `malloc' in
     `msvcrt.dll' is used.  This does impose a considerable performance
     penalty and has not been tested recently.

   * You can run a parallel make by e.g.

          make -j4 all
          make -j4 recommended

     but this is only likely to be worthwhile on a multi-core machine
     with ample memory, and is less than 100% reliable.

3.1.4 Building the bitmap files
-------------------------------

The file `R_HOME/library/grDevices/libs/Rbitmap.dll' is not built
automatically.

   Running `make' in `R_HOME/src/gnuwin32/bitmap' or `make bitmapdll'
in `R_HOME/src/gnuwin32' should build `Rbitmap.dll' and install it in
`R_HOME/bin'.


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Checking the build,  Next: Building the manuals,  Prev: Building the bitmap files,  Up: Building from source

3.1.5 Checking the build
------------------------

You can test a build by running `make check'.  You may need to set `TMPDIR'
to the absolute path to a suitable temporary directory: the default is
`c:/TEMP'.  (Use forward slashes and do not use a path including
spaces.  It will be ignored if not set to a directory.)

   The recommended packages can be  checked by

     make check-recommended

   Other levels of checking are

     make check-devel

for a more thorough check of the R functionality, and

     make check-all

for `check-devel' and `check-recommended'.


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Building the manuals,  Next: Building the Inno Setup installer,  Prev: Checking the build,  Up: Building from source

3.1.6 Building the manuals
--------------------------

The PDF manuals can be made by

     make manuals

If you want to make the info versions (not the Reference Manual), use

     cd ../../doc/manual
     make -f Makefile.win info

To make DVI versions of the manuals use

     cd ../../doc/manual
     make -f Makefile.win dvi

(all assuming you have `pdftex'/`pdflatex' or `tex'/`latex' installed
and in your path).

   See the *Note Making the manuals:: section in the Unix section for
setting options such as the paper size.


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Building the Inno Setup installer,  Next: Building the MSI installer,  Prev: Building the manuals,  Up: Building from source

3.1.7 Building the Inno Setup installer
---------------------------------------

You need to have the files for a complete R build, including bitmap and
Tcl/Tk support and the manuals, as well as the recommended packages and
Inno Setup (*note The Inno Setup installer::).

   Once everything is set up

     make distribution
     make check-all

will make all the pieces and the installers and put them in the
`gnuwin32/cran' subdirectory, then check the build.  This works by
building all the parts in the sequence:

     Rpwd.exe (a utility needed in the build)
     rbuild (the executables, the FAQ docs etc.)
     rpackage (the base packages)
     htmldocs (the HTML documentation)
     bitmapdll (the bitmap support files)
     recommended (the recommended packages)
     vignettes (the vignettes in package *grid*:
     	   only needed if building from an svn checkout)
     manuals (the PDF manuals)
     rinstaller (the install program)
     crandir (the CRAN distribution directory)

   The parts can be made individually if a full build is not needed, but
earlier parts must be built before later ones.  (The `Makefile' doesn't
enforce this dependency--some build targets force a lot of computation
even if all files are up to date.)  The first four targets are the
default build if just `make' is run.

   If you want to customize the installation by adding extra packages,
replace `make rinstaller' by something like

     make rinstaller EXTRA_PKGS='pkg1 pkg2 pkg3'

   An alternative way to customize the installer starting with a binary
distribution is to first make a full installation of R from the standard
installer (that is, select `Full Installation' from the `Select
Components' screen), then add packages and make other customizations to
that installation.  Then in `src/gnuwin32/installer' run

     make myR IMAGEDIR=rootdir

where `rootdir' is the path to the root of the customized installation
(forward slashes and no spaces, please).

   Both methods create an executable with the standard name,
`R-2.10.1-win32.exe', so please rename it to indicate that it is
customized.  If you intend to _distribute_ a customized installer
please do check that license requirements are met - note that the
installer will state that the contents are distributed under GPL-2 and
this has a requirement for _you_ to supply the complete sources
(including the R sources even if you started with a binary distribution
of R).

   The defaults for the startup parameters may also be customized.  For
example

     make myR IMAGEDIR=rootdir MDISDI=1

will create an installer that defaults to installing R to run in SDI
mode.  See `src/gnuwin32/installer/Makefile' for the names and values
that can be set.

3.1.8 Building the MSI installer
--------------------------------

It is also possible to build an installer for use with Microsoft
Installer.  This is intended for use by sysadmins doing automated
installs, and is not recommended for casual use.

   It makes use of the Windows Installer XML (WiX) toolkit _version
2.0_ available from `http://wix.sourceforge.net/'.  (This needs the
.NET 1.1 framework installed: it ran on a vanilla Windows XP SP2
machine. Unfortunately the file format has been changed within the same
version: currently our code works with releases 2.0.4221.0 and
2.0.5805.0 - the latter is now said to be `production/stable'.)  Once
WiX is installed, set the path to its home directory in `MkRules'.

   You need to have the files for a complete R build, including bitmap
and Tcl/Tk support and the manuals, as well as the recommended packages.
There is no option in the installer to customize startup options, so
edit `etc/Rconsole' and `etc/Rprofile.site' to set these as required.
Then

     cd installer
     make msi

which will results in a file of about 45Mb with a name like
`R-2.10.1-win32.msi'.  This can be double-clicked to be installed, but
those who need it will know what to do with it.

   Thanks to David del Campo (Dept of Statistics, University of Oxford)
for suggesting WiX and building a prototype installer.

File: R-admin.info,  Node: Testing a Windows Installation,  Prev: Building from source,  Up: Installing R under Windows

3.2 Testing an Installation
===========================

The Windows installer contains a set of test files used when building
R.  These are an optional part of the installation, and if it is
desired to run tests on the installation these should be selected as
well as the help source files (perhaps most easily by doing a `Full
Installation').

   The `Rtools' are not needed to run these tests. but more
comprehensive analysis of errors will be given if `diff' is in the path.

   Once this has been done, launch either `Rgui' or `Rterm', preferably
with `--vanilla'.  Then

     library("tools")
     testInstalledBasic("both")
     testInstalledPackages("base")
     testInstalledPackages("recommended")

runs the basic tests and then all the tests on the standard and
recommended packages.  These tests can be run from anywhere: they write
their results in the `tests' folder of the R home directory (as given
by `R.home()').

4 Installing R under Mac OS X
*****************************

The `bin/macosx' directory of a CRAN site contains binaries for Mac OS
X for a base distribution and a large number of add-on packages from
CRAN to run on Mac OS X version 10.4.4 or higher.

   The simplest way is to use `R-2.10.1.dmg'.  Just double-click on the
icon and the disk image file will be mounted. Read the `ReadMe.txt'
inside the disk image and follow the instructions.

   See the R for Mac OS X FAQ
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/bin/macosx/RMacOSX-FAQ.html) for more
details.

* Building from source on Mac OS X::


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Building from source on Mac OS X,  Prev: Installing R under Mac OS X,  Up: Installing R under Mac OS X

4.1 Building from source on Mac OS X
====================================

If you want to build this port from the sources, you can read the above
mentioned R for Mac OS X FAQ
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/bin/macosx/RMacOSX-FAQ.html) for full
details.  You will need to collect and install some tools as explained
in the document.  Then you have to expand the R sources and configure R
appropriately, for example

     tar zxvf R-2.10.1.tar.gz
     cd R-2.10.1
     ./configure --with-blas='-framework vecLib' --with-lapack \
       --with-aqua --enable-R-framework
     make

and then sit back and wait.  The first two options are the default (and
strongly recommended), and with some toolsets have been essential.

   The second line of options is also default on Mac OS X, but needed
only if you want to build R for use with `R.app' Console, and imply
`--enable-R-shlib' to build R as a shared/dynamic library.  These
options configure R to be built and installed as a framework called
`R.framework'.  The default path for `R.framework' is
`/Library/Frameworks' but this can be changed at configure time by
specifying the flag `--enable-R-framework[=DIR]' or at install time as

     make prefix=/where/you/want/R.framework/to/go install

(the `R.framework' directory should not be included in the path).

   For compatibility with the CRAN distribution you may need to specify
`--with-included-gettext' to avoid linking against a `libintl' dynamic
library you may have available, for example in `/usr/local/lib'.

   Note that building the `R.app' GUI console is a separate project:
see the Mac OS X FAQ for details.

5 Running R
***********

How to start R and what command-line options are available is discussed
in *Note Invoking R: (R-intro)Invoking R.

   You should ensure that the shell has set adequate resource limits: R
expects a stack size of at least 8MB and to be able to open at least 256
file descriptors.  (Any modern OS will have default limits at least as
large as these, but apparently NetBSD does not.)

   R makes use of a number of environment variables, the default values
of many of which are set in file `R_HOME/etc/Renviron' (there are none
set by default on Windows and hence no such file).  These are set at
`configure' time, and you would not normally want to change them - a
possible exception is `R_PAPERSIZE' (*note Setting paper size::).  The
paper size will be deduced from the `LC_PAPER' locale category if it
exists and `R_PAPERSIZE' is unset, and this will normally produce the
right choice from `a4' and `letter' on modern Unix-alikes (but can
always be overridden by setting `R_PAPERSIZE').

   Various environment variables can be set to determine where R creates
its per-session temporary directory.  The environment variables `TMPDIR',
`TMP' and `TEMP' are searched in turn and the first one which is set
and points to a writable area is used.  If none do, the final default
is `/tmp' on Unix-alikes and the value of `R_USER' on Windows.

   Some Unix-alike systems are set up to remove files and directories
periodically from `/tmp', for example by a `cron' job running
`tmpwatch'.  Set `TMPDIR' to another directory before running
long-running jobs on such a system.

   Note that `TMPDIR' will be used to execute `configure' scripts when
installing packages, so if `/tmp' has been mounted as `noexec',
`TMPDIR' needs to be set to a directory from which execution is allowed.

*****************

* Menu:

* Default packages::
* Managing libraries::
* Installing packages::
* Updating packages::
* Removing packages::
* Setting up a package repository::

   It is helpful to use the correct terminology.  A _package_ is loaded
from a _library_ by the function `library()'.  Thus a library is a
directory containing installed packages; the main library is
`R_HOME/library', but others can be used, for example by setting the
environment variable `R_LIBS' or using the R function `.libPaths()'.


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Default packages,  Next: Managing libraries,  Prev: Add-on packages,  Up: Add-on packages

6.1 Default packages
====================

The set of packages loaded on startup is by default

     > getOption("defaultPackages")
     [1] "datasets"  "utils"     "grDevices" "graphics"  "stats"     "methods"

(plus, of course, *base*) and this can be changed by setting the option
in startup code (e.g. in `~/.Rprofile').  It is initially set to the
value of the environment variable `R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES' if set (as a
comma-separated list).  Setting `R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES=NULL' ensures that
only package *base* is loaded.

   Changing the set of default packages is normally used to reduce the
set for speed when scripting: in particular not using *methods* will
reduce the start-up time by a factor of two or more (and this is done by
`Rscript').  But it can also be used to customize R, e.g.  for class
use.


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Managing libraries,  Next: Installing packages,  Prev: Default packages,  Up: Add-on packages

6.2 Managing libraries
======================

R packages are installed into _libraries_, which are directories in the
file system containing a subdirectory for each package installed there.

   R comes with a single library, `R_HOME/library' which is the value
of the R object `.Library' containing the standard and recommended(1)
packages.  Both sites and users can create others and make use of them
(or not) in an R session.  At the lowest level `.libPaths()' can be
used to add paths to the collection of libraries or to report the
current collection.

   R will automatically make use of a site-specific library
`R_HOME/site-library' if this exists (it does not in a vanilla R
installation).  This location can be overridden by setting(2)
`.Library.site' in `R_HOME/etc/Rprofile.site', or (not recommended) by
setting the environment variable `R_LIBS_SITE'.  Like `.Library', the
site libraries are always included by `.libPaths()'.

   Users can have one or more libraries, normally specified by the
environment variable `R_LIBS_USER'.  This has a default value (use
`Sys.getenv("R_LIBS_USER")' within an R session to see what it is), but
only is used if the corresponding directory actually exists (which by
default it will not).

   Both `R_LIBS_USER' and `R_LIBS_SITE' can specify multiple library
paths, separated by colons (semicolons on Windows).

6.3 Installing packages
=======================

* Menu:

* Windows packages::
* Mac OS X packages::
* Customizing package compilation::

   Packages may be distributed in source form or compiled binary form.
Installing source packages requires that compilers and tools be
installed.  Binary packages are platform-specific and generally need no
special tools to install, but see the documentation for your platform
for details.

   Note that you need to specify implicitly or explicitly the library to
which the package is to be installed.  This is only an issue if you have
more than one library, of course.

   If installing packages to be used by other users, ensure that the
system `umask' is set to give sufficient permissions (see also
`Sys.umask' in R).

   For most users it suffices to call `install.packages(PKGNAME)' or
its GUI equivalent if the intention is to install a CRAN package and
internet access is available.(1)  On most systems `install.packages()'
will allow packages to be selected from a list box.

   To install packages from source in Unix use

     R CMD INSTALL -l /path/to/library PKG1 PKG2 ...

The part `-l /path/to/library' can be omitted, in which case the first
library in `R_LIBS' is used if set, otherwise the main library
`R_HOME/library' is used.  (`R_LIBS' is looked for in the environment:
note that `.Renviron' is not read by `R CMD'.)  Ensure that the
environment variable `TMPDIR' is either unset (and `/tmp' exists and
can be written in and executed from) or points to a valid temporary
directory.

   There are a number of options available: use `R CMD INSTALL --help'
to see the current list.

   Alternatively, packages can be downloaded and installed from within
R.  First set the option `CRAN' to your nearest CRAN mirror using
`chooseCRANmirror()'.  Then download and install packages *pkg1* and
*pkg2* by

     > install.packages(c("pkg1", "pkg2"))

The essential dependencies of the specified packages will also be
fetched.  Unless the library is specified (argument `lib') the first
library in the library search path is used: if this is not writable, R
will ask the user (in an interactive session) if the default user
library should be created, and if allowed to will install the packages
there.

   If you want to fetch a package and all those it depends on that are
not already installed, use e.g.

     > install.packages("Rcmdr", dependencies = TRUE)

   `install.packages' can install a source package from a local
`.tar.gz' file by setting argument `repos' to `NULL': this will be
selected automatically if the name given is a single `.tar.gz' file.

   `install.packages' can look in several repositories, specified as a
character vector by the argument `repos': these can include a CRAN
mirror, Bioconductor, Omegahat, local archives, local files, ...).
Function `setRepositories()' can select amongst those repositories that
the R installation is aware of.

6.3.1 Windows
-------------

What `install.packages' does by default is different on Unix-alikes
(except Mac OS X) and Windows.  On Unix-alikes it consults the list of
available _source_ packages on CRAN (or other repository/ies),
downloads the latest version of the package sources, and installs them
(via `R CMD INSTALL').  On Windows it looks (by default) at the list of
_binary_ versions of packages available for your version of R and
downloads the latest versions (if any), although optionally it will
also download and install a source package by setting the `type'
argument.

   On Windows `install.packages' can also install a binary package from
a local `zip' file by setting argument `repos' to `NULL'.   `Rgui.exe'
has a menu `Packages' with a GUI interface to `install.packages',
`update.packages' and `library'.

   `R CMD INSTALL' works in Windows to install source packages if you
have set up the tools needed (see *Note The Windows toolset::).
Installation of binary packages must be done by `install.packages'.  `R
CMD INSTALL --help' will tell you the current options under Windows
(which differ from those on a Unix-alike): in particular there is a
choice of the types of documentation to be installed.

   If you have only a source package that is known to work with current
R and just want a binary Windows build of it, you could make use of the
building service offered at `http://win-builder.r-project.org/'.

6.3.2 Mac OS X
--------------

On Mac OS X `install.packages' works as it does on other Unix-like
systems, but there is an additional type `mac.binary' (the default in
the CRAN distribution) that can be passed to `install.packages' in
order to download and install binary packages from a suitable
repository, and is the default for CRAN builds of R.  These Macintosh
binary package files have the extension `tgz'.  The R GUI provides for
installation of either binary or source packages, from CRAN or local
files.

6.3.3 Customizing package compilation
-------------------------------------

The R system and package-specific compilation flags can be overridden or
added to by setting the appropriate Make variables in the personal file
`HOME/.R/Makevars-R_PLATFORM' (but `HOME/.R/Makevars.win' on Windows),
or if that does not exist, `HOME/.R/Makevars', where `R_PLATFORM' is the
platform for which R was built, as available in the `platform'
component of the R variable `R.version'.

   Package developers are encouraged to use this mechanism to enable a
reasonable amount of diagnostic messaging ("warnings") when compiling,
such as e.g. `-Wall -pedantic' for tools from GCC, the Gnu Compiler
Collection.

   Note that this mechanism can also be used when it necessary to change
the optimization level for a particular package.  For example

     ## for C code
     CFLAGS=-g -O
     ## for C++ code
     CXXFLAGS=-g -O
     ## for Fortran code
     FFLAGS=-g -O
     ## for Fortran 95 code
     FCFLAGS=-g -O

6.4 Updating packages
=====================

The command `update.packages()' is the simplest way to ensure that all
the packages on your system are up to date.  Set the `repos' argument
as in the previous section.  The `update.packages()' downloads the list
of available packages and their current versions, compares it with
those installed and offers to fetch and install any that have later
versions on the repositories.

   An alternative interface to keeping packages up-to-date is provided
by the command `packageStatus()', which returns an object with
information on all installed packages and packages available at multiple
repositories.  The `print' and `summary' methods give an overview of
installed and available packages, the `upgrade' method offers to fetch
and install the latest versions of outdated packages.


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Removing packages,  Next: Setting up a package repository,  Prev: Updating packages,  Up: Add-on packages

6.5 Removing packages
=====================

Packages can be removed in a number of ways.  From a command prompt they
can be removed by

     R CMD REMOVE -l /path/to/library PKG1 PKG2 ...

   From a running R process they can be removed by

     > remove.packages(c("pkg1", "pkg2"),
                       lib = file.path("path", "to", "library"))

   Finally, in most installations one can just remove the package
directory from the library (but for a package from a bundle, be sure to
remove the whole bundle).


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Setting up a package repository,  Prev: Removing packages,  Up: Add-on packages

6.6 Setting up a package repository
===================================

Utilities such as `install.packages' can be pointed at any CRAN-style
repository, and R users may want to set up their own.  The `base' of a
repository is a URL such as `http://www.omegahat.org/R/': this must be
an URL scheme that `download.packages' supports (which also includes
`ftp://' and `file://').  Under that base URL there should be directory
trees for one or more of the following types of package distributions:

   * `"source"': located at `src/contrib' and containing `.tar.gz'
     files.  As from R 2.10.0 other forms of compression can be used,
     e.g. `.tar.bz2' or `.tar.xz' files.

   * `"win.binary"': located at `bin/windows/contrib/X.Y' for R
     versions X.Y.Z and containing `.zip' files.

   * `"mac.binary"': located at `bin/macosx/universal/contrib/X.Y' for
     R versions X.Y.Z and containing `.tgz' files.  If the repository
     contains only packages for a specific architecture, the package
     distribution type can be set to `"mac.binary.xxx"' where XXX
     specifies the architecture, replacing `universal' by XXX in the
     path above.  For packages built for the off-CRAN `leopard' binary,
     replace `universal' by `leopard'.

   Each terminal directory must also contain a `PACKAGES' file.  This
can be a concatenation of the `DESCRIPTION' files of the packages
separated by blank lines (provided there are no bundles), but only a few
of the fields are needed.  The simplest way to set up such a file is to
use function `write_PACKAGES' in the *tools* package, and its help
explains which fields are needed.  Optionally there can also be a
`PACKAGES.gz' file, a `gzip'-compressed version of `PACKAGES'--as this
will be downloaded in preference to `PACKAGES' it should be included
for large repositories.

   To add your repository to the list offered by `setRepositories()',
see the help file for that function.

   A repository can contain subdirectories, when the descriptions in the
`PACKAGES' file of packages in subdirectories must include a line of
the form

     Path: PATH/TO/SUBDIRECTORY

--once again `write_PACKAGES' is the simplest way to set this up.

7 Internationalization and Localization
***************************************

_Internationalization_ refers to the process of enabling support for
many human languages, and _localization_ to adapting to a specific
country and language.

   Historically R worked in the ISO Latin-1 8-bit character set and so
covered English and most Western European languages (if not necessarily
their currency symbols).  Since R 2.1.0 it has supported (optionally
before R 2.10.0) multi-byte character sets such as UTF-8 and others
used for Chinese, Japanese and Korean.

   Current builds of R support all the character sets that the
underlying OS can handle.  These are interpreted according to the current
`locale', a sufficiently complicated topic to merit a separate section.

   The other aspect of the internationalization is support for the
translation of messages.  This is enabled in almost all builds of R.

* Menu:

* Locales::
* Localization of messages::


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Locales,  Next: Localization of messages,  Prev: Internationalization,  Up: Internationalization

7.1 Locales
===========

A _locale_ is a description of the local environment of the user,
including the preferred language, the encoding of characters, the
currency used and its conventions, and so on.  Aspects of the locale are
accessed by the R functions `Sys.getlocale' and `Sys.localeconv'.

   The system of naming locales is OS-specific.  There is quite wide
agreement on schemes, but not on the details of their implementation.  A
locale needs to specify
   * A human language.  These are generally specified by a lower-case
     two-character abbreviation following ISO 639 (see e.g.
     `http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1').

   * A `territory', used mainly to specify the currency. These are
     generally specified by an upper-case two-character abbreviation
     following ISO 3166 (see e.g.
     `http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166').  Sometimes the
     combination of language and territory is used to specify the
     encoding, for example to distinguish between traditional and
     simplified Chinese.

   * A charset encoding, which determines both how a byte stream should
     be divided into characters, and which characters the subsequences
     of bytes represent.

   * Optionally, a modifier, for example to indicate that Austria is to
     be considered pre- or post-Euro.

   R is principally concerned with the first (for translations) and
third.  Note that the charset may be deducible from the language, as
some OSes offer only one charset per language, and most OSes have only
one charset each for many languages.  Note too the remark above about
Chinese.

7.1.1 Locales under Linux
-------------------------

Modern Linux uses the XPG locale specifications which have the form
`en_GB', `en_GB.utf8', `aa_ER.utf8@saaho', `de_AT.iso885915@euro', the
components being in the order listed above.  (See `man locale' and
`locale -a' for more details.)  Similar schemes (but often in different
cases) are used by most Unix-alikes: some use `.UTF-8' rather than
`.utf8'.

7.1.2 Locales under Windows
---------------------------

Windows also uses locales, but specified in a rather less concise way.
Most users will encounter locales only via drop-down menus, but more
information and lists can be found at
`http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/vccore98/html/_crt_language_and_country_strings.asp'.

   It offers only one encoding per language.


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Locales under Mac OS X,  Prev: Locales under Windows,  Up: Locales

7.1.3 Locales under Mac OS X
----------------------------

Mac OS X supports locales in its own particular way, but the R GUI tries
to make this easier for users. See
`http://developer.apple.com/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPInternational/'
for how users can set their locales.  As with Windows, end users will
generally only see lists of languages/territories.  Users of R in a
terminal may need to set the locale to something like `en_GB.UTF-8' if
it defaults to `C'.

   Internally Mac OS X uses a form similar to Linux but without
specifying the encoding (which is `UTF-8').  It is based on ICU locales
(`http://userguide.icu-project.org/locale') and not POSIX ones.


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Localization of messages,  Prev: Locales,  Up: Internationalization

7.2 Localization of messages
============================

The preferred language for messages is by default taken from the locale.
This can be overridden first by the setting of the environment variable `LANGUAGE'
and then(1) by the environment variables `LC_ALL', `LC_MESSAGES' and
`LANG'. (The last three are normally used to set the locale and so
should not be needed, but the first is only used to select the language
for messages.)  The code tries hard to map locales to languages, but on
some systems (notably Windows) the locale names needed for the
environment variable `LC_ALL' do not all correspond to XPG language
names and so `LANGUAGE' may need to be set.  (One example is
`LC_ALL=es' on Windows which sets the locale to Estonian and the
language to Spanish.)

   It is usually possible to change the language once R is running
_via_ (not Windows) `Sys.setlocale("LC_MESSAGES", "new_locale")', or by
setting an environment variable such as `LANGUAGE', _provided_(2) the
language you are changing to can be output in the current character set.

   Messages are divided into _domains_, and translations may be
available for some or all messages in a domain.  R makes use of the
following domains.

   * Domain `R' for basic C-level error messages.

   * Domain `R-PKG' for the R `stop', `warning' and `message' messages
     in each package, including `R-base' for the *base* package.

   * Domain `PKG' for the C-level messages in each package.

   * Domain `RGui' for the menus etc of the R for Windows GUI front-end.


   Dividing up the messages in this way allows R to be extensible: as
packages are loaded, their message translation catalogues can be loaded
too.

   Translations are looked for by domain according to the currently
specified language, as specifically as possible, so for example an
Austrian (`de_AT') translation catalogue will be used in preference to
a generic German one (`de') for an Austrian user.  However, if a
specific translation catalogue exists but does not contain a
translation, the less specific catalogues are consulted.  For example,
R has catalogues for `en_GB' that translate the Americanisms (e.g.,
`gray') in the standard messages into English.  Two other examples:
there are catalogues for `es', which is Spanish as written in Spain and
these will by default also be used in Spanish-speaking Latin American
countries, and also for `pt_BR', which are used for Brazilian locales
but not for locales specifying Portugal.

   Translations in the right language but the wrong charset be made use
of by on-the-fly re-encoding.  The `LANGUAGE' variable (only) can be a
colon-separated list, for example `se:de', giving a set of languages in
decreasing order of preference.  One special value is `en@quot', which
can be used in a UTF-8 locale to have American error messages with
pairs of quotes translated to Unicode directional quotes.

   If no suitable translation catalogue is found or a particular
message is not translated in any suitable catalogue, `English'(3) is
used.

   See `http://developer.r-project.org/Translations.html' for how to
prepare and install translation catalogues.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) On some systems setting `LC_ALL' or `LC_MESSAGES' to `C'
disables `LANGUAGE'.

locale, you will find messages change to English.

8 Choosing between 32- and 64-bit builds
****************************************

* Menu:

* Windows::

   Many current CPUs have both 32- and 64-bit sets of instructions:
this has long been true for UltraSparc and more recently for MIPS, PPC
and `x86_64' (AMD Opteron and Athlon64, Intel Xeon and Pentium/'Core'
supporting EM64T).  Many OSes running on such CPUs offer the choice of
building a 32-bit or a 64-bit version of R (and details are given below
under specific OSes).  For most a 32-bit version is the default, but
for some (e.g., `x86_64' Linux) 64-bit is.

   All current versions of R use 32-bit integers and IEC 60559(1)
double-precision reals, and so compute to the same precision(2) and
with the same limits on the sizes of numerical quantities.  The
principal difference is in the size of the pointers.

   64-bit builds have both advantages and disadvantages:
   * The total virtual memory space made available to a 32-bit
     process(3) is limited to 4GB, and on most OSes to 3GB (or even
     2GB).  The limits for 64-bit processes are much larger.

     R allocates memory for large objects as needed, and removes any
     unused ones at garbage collection.  When the sizes of objects
     become an appreciable fraction of the address limit, fragmentation
     of the address space becomes an issue and there may be no hole
     available that is the size requested.  This can cause more
     frequent garbage collection or the inability to allocate large
     objects.  As a guide, this will become an issue with objects more
     than 10% of the size of the address space (around 300Mb) or when
     the total size of objects in use is around one third (around 1Gb).

   * 32-bit OSes by default limit file sizes to 2GB.  This can often be
     worked around: and `configure' selects suitable defines if this is
     possible.  (We have also largely worked around that limit on
     Windows.)  64-bit builds have much larger limits.

   * Because the pointers are larger, R's basic structure (the cons
     cell) is larger (normally twice the size).  This means that R
     objects take more space and (usually) more time to manipulate.  So
     64-bit versions of R will typically run slower than 32-bit
     versions.  (On Sparc Solaris the difference was 15-20%, on Linux
     on Opteron around 10%.  The pattern is not universal, as on Intel
     Core 2 Duo the vanilla 64-bit version is around 10% faster on both
     Linux and Mac OS X -- this can be reduced by tuning the compile to
     that chip.)

   So, for speed you may want to use a 32-bit build, but to handle large
datasets (and perhaps large files) a 64-bit build.  You can build both
and install them in the same place: *Note Sub-architectures::.

   Even on 64-bit builds of R there are limits on the size of R objects
(see `help("Memory-limits")', some of which stem from the use of 32-bit
integers (especially in FORTRAN code).  On all versions of R, the
maximum length (number of elements) of a vector is 2^31-1, about 2
billion, and on 64-bit systems the size of a block of memory allocated
is limited to 2^34-1 bytes (8GB).  It is anticipated these will be
raised eventually but routine use of 8GB objects is (when this was
written in 2005) several years off.

8.1 Windows
===========

Currently the Windows build of R from CRAN is a 32-bit executable.
This runs happily on Windows 64 on AMD64 and EM64T, but is limited to
an address space of 2 to 4GB (see the `R for Windows FAQ' for details).
It will not be possible fro the R project to provide a native version
for Windows 64 until suitable non-commercial compilers are available,
and currently (early 2009) the experimental version of MinGW for 64-bit
Windows is not yet good enough to build a working R.  Commercial 64-bit
compilers have been used, and R can be be built with such compilers
with minimal changes to the sources (and constructing suitable project
files).

9 The standalone Rmath library
******************************

The routines supporting the distribution and special(1) functions in R
and a few others are declared in C header file `Rmath.h'.  These can be
compiled into a standalone library for linking to other applications.
(Note that they are not a separate library when R is built, and the
standalone version differs in several ways.)

   The makefiles and other sources needed are in directory
`src/nmath/standalone', so the following instructions assume that is
the current working directory (in the build directory tree on Unix if
that is separate from the sources).

   `Rmath.h' contains `R_VERSION_STRING', which is a character string
containing the current R version, for example `"2.6.0"'.

   There is full access to R's handling of `NaN's, `Inf' and `-Inf' via
special versions of the macros and functions

         ISNAN, R_FINITE, R_log, R_pow and R_pow_di

and (extern) constants `R_PosInf', `R_NegInf' and `NA_REAL'.

   There is no support for R's notion of missing values, in particular
not for `NA_INTEGER' nor the distinction between `NA' and `NaN' for
doubles.

   A little care is needed to use the random-number routines. You will
need to supply the uniform random number generator

         double unif_rand(void)

or use the one supplied (and with a shared library or DLL you will have
to use the one supplied, which is the Marsaglia-multicarry with an
entry point

         set_seed(unsigned int, unsigned int)

to set its seeds).

   The facilities to change the normal random number generator are
available through the constant N01_kind. This takes values from the
enumeration type

     typedef enum {
         BUGGY_KINDERMAN_RAMAGE,
         AHRENS_DIETER,
         BOX_MULLER,
         USER_NORM,
         INVERSION,
         KINDERMAN_RAMAGE
     } N01type;

(and `USER_NORM' is not available).

9.1 Unix
========

If R has not already be made in the directory tree, `configure' must be
run as described in the main build instructions.

   Then

     make

will make standalone libraries `libRmath.a' and `libRmath.so': `make
static' and `make shared' will create just one of them.

   *NB:* certain compilers are unable to do compile-time IEEE-754
arithmetic and so cannot compile `mlutils.c' and several other files.
The known example is old versions of Sun's `cc' (e.g.  Forte 6 and 7).

   To use the routines in your own C or C++ programs, include

     #define MATHLIB_STANDALONE
     #include <Rmath.h>

and link against `-lRmath' (and `-lm' if needed on your OS).  The
example file `test.c' does nothing useful, but is provided to test the
process (via `make test').  Note that you will probably not be able to
run it unless you add the directory containing `libRmath.so' to the
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable.

   The targets

     make install
     make uninstall

will (un)install the header `Rmath.h' and shared and static libraries
(if built).  Both `prefix=' and `DESTDIR' are supported, together with
more precise control as described for the main build.

   `make install' installs a file for `pkg-config' to use by e.g.

     $(CC) `pkg-config --cflags libRmath` -c test.c
     $(CC) `pkg-config --libs libRmath` test.o -o test

   On some systems `make install-strip' will install a stripped shared
library.


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Windows standalone,  Prev: Unix standalone,  Up: The standalone Rmath library

9.2 Windows
===========

You need to set up almost all the tools to make R and then run (in a
Unix-like shell)

     (cd ../../include; make -f Makefile.win config.h Rconfig.h Rmath.h)
     make -f Makefile.win

For `cmd.exe' use

     cd ../../include
     make -f Makefile.win config.h Rconfig.h Rmath.h
     cd ../nmath/standalone
     make -f Makefile.win

   This creates a static library `libRmath.a' and a DLL `Rmath.dll'.
If you want an import library `libRmath.dll.a' (you don't need one), use

     make -f Makefile.win shared implib

   To use the routines in your own C or C++ programs using MinGW,
include

     #define MATHLIB_STANDALONE
     #include <Rmath.h>

and link against `-lRmath'.  This will use the first found of
`libRmath.dll.a', `libRmath.a' and `Rmath.dll' in that order, so the
result depends on which files are present.  You should be able to force
static or dynamic linking  _via_

     -Wl,-Bstatic -lRmath -Wl,dynamic
     -Wl,-Bdynamic -lRmath

or by linking to explicit files (as in the `test' target in
`Makefile.win': this makes two executables, `test.exe' which is
dynamically linked, and `test-static', which is statically linked).

   It is possible to link to `Rmath.dll' using other compilers, either
directly or via an import library: if you make a MinGW import library as
above, you will create a file `Rmath.def' which can be used (possibly
after editing) to create an import library for other systems such as
Visual C++.

   If you make use of dynamic linking you should use

     #define MATHLIB_STANDALONE
     #define RMATH_DLL
     #include <Rmath.h>

to ensure that the constants like `NA_REAL' are linked correctly.
(Auto-import will probably work with MinGW, but it is better to be
sure. This is likely to also work with VC++, Borland and similar
compilers.)

Appendix A Essential and useful other programs under Unix
*********************************************************

This appendix gives details of programs you will need to build R on
Unix-like platforms, or which will be used by R if found by `configure'.

   Remember that some package management systems (such as RPM and deb)
make a distinction between the user version of a package and the
development version.  The latter usually has the same name but with the
extension `-devel' or `-dev': you need both versions installed.

File: R-admin.info,  Node: Essential programs and libraries,  Next: Useful libraries and programs,  Prev: Essential and useful other programs under Unix,  Up: Essential and useful other programs under Unix

A.1 Essential programs and libraries
====================================

You need a means of compiling C and FORTRAN 77 (see *Note Using
FORTRAN::).  Some add-on packages also need a C++ compiler.  Your C
compiler should be IEC 60059(1), POSIX 1003.1 and C99-compliant if at
all possible.  R tries to choose suitable flags for the C compilers it
knows about, but you may have to set `CC' or `CFLAGS' suitably.  For
recent versions of `gcc' with `glibc' this means including
`-std=gnu99'(2).  If the compiler is detected as `gcc', `-std=gnu99'
will be appended to `CC' unless it conflicts with a setting of `CFLAGS'.

   Unless you do not want to view graphs on-screen you need `X11'
installed, including its headers and client libraries. For recent Fedora
distributions it means (at least) `libX11', `libX11-devel', `libXt' and
`libXt-devel'.  On Debian we recommend the meta-package `xorg-dev'.  If
you really do not want these you will need to explicitly configure R
without X11, using `--with-x=no'.

   The command-line editing (and command completion) depends on the
`readline' library available from any GNU mirror: version 4.2 or later
is needed for all the features to be enabled.  Otherwise you will need
to configure with `--with-readline=no' (or equivalent).

   A suitably comprehensive `iconv' function is essential.  The R usage
requires `iconv' to be able to translate between `"latin1"' and
`"UTF-8"', to recognize `""' as the current encoding and to translate
to and from the Unicode wide-character formats `"UCS-[24][BL]E"' --
this is true for `glibc' but not of most commercial Unixes.  However,
you can make use of GNU `libiconv' (possibly as a plug-in replacement:
see `http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/'.

   The OS needs to have enough support(3) for wide-character types:
this is checked at configuration.

   A `tar' program is needed to unpack the sources and packages
(including the recommended packages).  A version(4) that can
automagically detect compressed archives is preferred for use with
`untar()': the configure script looks for `gtar' before `tar': use
environment variable `TAR' to override this.

   You will not be able to build most of the manuals unless you have
`makeinfo' version 4.7 or later installed , and if not some of the HTML
manuals will be linked to CRAN.  (Version 4.6 is known to create
incorrect HTML files.)  To make DVI or PDF versions of the manuals you
will also need `texinfo.tex' installed (which is part of the GNU
*texinfo* distribution but is often made part of the TeX package in
re-distributions) as well as `texi2dvi'.

   The DVI and PDF documentation and building vignettes needs `tex' and
`latex', or `pdftex' and `pdflatex'.

   If you want to build from the R Subversion repository you need both
`makeinfo' and `pdflatex'.  

   The essential programs should be in your `PATH' at the time
`configure' is run: this will capture the full paths.

A.2 Useful libraries and programs
=================================

The ability to use translated messages makes use of `gettext' and most
likely needs GNU `gettext': you do need this to work with new
translations, but otherwise the version contained in the R sources will
be used if no suitable external `gettext' is found.

   The `modern' version of `X11', `jpeg()', `png()' and `tiff()' uses
the `cairo' and (optionally) `Pango' libraries.  Cairo version 1.2.0 or
later is required.  Pango needs to be at least version 1.10, and 1.12
is the earliest version we have tested.  (For Fedora users we believe
the `pango-devel' RPM and its dependencies suffice.)  R checks for
`pkg-config', and uses that to check first that the `pangocairo'
package is installed (and if not, `cairo') and if additional flags are
needed for the `cairo-xlib' package, then if suitable code can be
compiled.  These tests will fail if `pkg-config' is not installed, and
are likely to fail if `cairo' was built statically (unusual).  Most
systems with `Gtk+' 2.8 or later installed will have suitable libraries,
but some (e.g. Solaris 10) may need `cairo' added separately.  Mac OS X
comes with none of these libraries, but `cairo' support has been added
to the binary distribution: `pkg-config' is still needed and can be
compiled from the sources.

   For the best font experience with these devices you need suitable
fonts installed: Linux users will want the `urw-fonts' package.  Another
useful set of fonts is the `liberation' truetype fonts available at
`https://www.redhat.com/promo/fonts/', which cover the Latin, Greek and
Cyrillic alphabets plus a fair range of signs.  These share metrics
with Arial, Times New Roman and Courier New, and contain fonts rather
similar to the first two
(`http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_fonts').

   The bitmapped graphics devices `jpeg()', `png()' and `tiff()' need
the appropriate headers and libraries installed: `jpeg' (version 6b or
7) or `libpng' (version 1.2.3 or later) and `zlib' (version 1.1.3 or
later) or `libtiff' (any recent version - 3.8.2 was tested)
respectively.

   If you have them installed (including the appropriate headers and of
recent enough versions), `zlib', `libbz2' and PCRE will be used if
specified by `--with-system-zlib', `--with-system-bzlib' or
`--with-system-pcre': otherwise versions in the R sources will be
compiled in.  As the latter suffice and are tested with R you should
not need to change this.  In particular, the version of `zlib' 1.2.3 in
the R sources has enhancements to work with large file systems on
32-bit platforms.

   `liblzma' from `xv-utils' version 4.999 or later will be used if
installed: the version in the R sources can be selected instead by
configuring with `--with-system-xz=no'.

   Use of the X11 clipboard selection requires the `Xmu' headers and
libraries.  These are normally part of an X11 installation (e.g. the
Debian meta-package `xorg-dev'), but some distributions have split this
into smaller parts, so for example recent versions of Fedora require
the `libXmu' and `libXmu-devel' RPMs.

   Some systems (notably Mac OS X and at least some FreeBSD systems)
have inadequate support for collation in multibyte locales.  It is
possible to replace the OS's collation support by that from ICU
(International Components for Unicode, `http://site.icu-project.org/'),
and this provides much more precise control over collation on all
systems.  ICU is available as sources and as binary distributions for
(at least) most Linux distributions, Solaris 9/10, AIX and Windows,
usually as `libicu' or `icu4c'.  It will be used by default where
available (including on Mac OS X >= 10.4).

   Code developers will need Perl version 5.8.0 or later, available via
`http://www.perl.com/CPAN/'.  This is used to package and check
packages, for `R CMD Rprof'(1) and the rarely used `R CMD Sd2Rd': it
should be in your `PATH' when `configure' is run.

   The `bitmap' and `dev2bitmap' devices and also `embedFonts()' use
ghostscript (`http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost').  This should either be
in your path when the command is run, or its full path specified by the
environment variable `R_GSCMD' at that time.

A.2.1 Tcl/Tk
------------

The *tcltk* package needs Tcl/Tk >= 8.3 installed: the sources are
available at `http://www.tcl.tk/'.  To specify the locations of the
Tcl/Tk files you may need the configuration options

`--with-tcltk'
     use Tcl/Tk, or specify its library directory

`--with-tcl-config=TCL_CONFIG'
     specify location of `tclConfig.sh'

`--with-tk-config=TK_CONFIG'
     specify location of `tkConfig.sh'

or use the configure variables `TCLTK_LIBS' and `TCLTK_CPPFLAGS' to
specify the flags needed for linking against the Tcl and Tk libraries
and for finding the `tcl.h' and `tk.h' headers, respectively.  If you
have both 32- and 64-bit versions of Tcl/Tk installed, setting the
paths to the correct config files may be necessary to avoid confusion
between them.

   Versions of Tcl/Tk from 8.3.x to 8.5.7 have been used successfully.

A.2.2 Java support
------------------

`configure' looks for Java support on the host system, and if it finds
it sets some settings which are useful for Java-using packages.  `JAVA_HOME'
can be set during the `configure' run to point to a specific JRE/JDK.

   Principal amongst these are some library paths to the Java libraries
and JVM, which are stored in environment variable `R_JAVA_LD_LIBRARY_PATH'
in file `R_HOME/etc/ldpaths' (or a sub-architecture-specific version).
A typical setting for Sun Java is

     /usr/java/jdk1.5.0_06/jre/lib/amd64/server:/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_06/jre/lib/amd64

   Note that this unfortunately depends on the exact version of the
JRE/JDK installed, and so will need updating if the Java installation is
updated.  This can be done by running `R CMD javareconf'. The script
re-runs Java detection in a manner similar to that of the `configure'
script and updates settings in both `Makeconf' and
`R_HOME/etc/ldpaths'. See `R CMD javareconf --help' for details.

   Another alternative of overriding those setting is to  set `R_JAVA_LD_LIBRARY_PATH'
(e.g. in `~/.Renviron'), or use `/etc/ld.so.conf' to specify the Java
runtime library paths to the system. Other settings are recorded in
`etc/Makeconf' (or a sub-architecture-specific version), e.g.

     JAVA = /usr/bin/java
     JAVAC = /usr/bin/javac
     JAVA_HOME = /usr/java/jdk1.5.0_06/jre
     JAVA_LD_LIBRARY_PATH = $(JAVA_HOME)/lib/amd64/server:$(JAVA_HOME)/lib/amd64:\
     $(JAVA_HOME)/../lib/amd64:/usr/local/lib64
     JAVA_LIBS = -L$(JAVA_HOME)/lib/amd64/server -L$(JAVA_HOME)/lib/amd64
                 -L$(JAVA_HOME)/../lib/amd64 -L/usr/local/lib64 -ljvm

where `JAVA_LIBS' contains flags necessary to link JNI programs.  Some
of the above variables can be queried using `R CMD config'.

A.3 Linear algebra
==================

* Menu:

* BLAS::
* LAPACK::
* Caveats::


File: R-admin.info,  Node: BLAS,  Next: LAPACK,  Prev: Linear algebra,  Up: Linear algebra

A.3.1 BLAS
----------

The linear algebra routines in R can make use of enhanced BLAS (Basic
Linear Algebra Subprograms, `http://www.netlib.org/blas/faq.html')
routines.  However, these have to be explicitly requested at configure
time: R provides an internal BLAS which is well-tested and will be
adequate for most uses of R.

   You can specify a particular BLAS library _via_ a value for the
configuration option `--with-blas' and not to use an external BLAS
library by `--without-blas' (the default).  If `--with-blas' is given
with no, its value is taken from the environment variable `BLAS_LIBS',
set for example in `config.site'.  If neither the option nor the
environment variable supply a value, a search is made for a suitable
BLAS.  If the value is not obviously a linker command (starting with a
dash or giving the path to a library), it is prefixed by `-l', so

     --with-blas="foo"

is an instruction to link against `-lfoo' to find an external BLAS
(which needs to be found both at link time and run time).

   The configure code checks that the external BLAS is complete (it must
include all double precision and double complex routines(1), as well as
`LSAME'), and appears to be usable.  However, an external BLAS has to
be usable from a shared object (so must contain position-independent
code), and that is not checked.

   Some enhanced BLASes are compiler-system-specific (`libsunperf' on
Sun Sparc(2), `libessl' on IBM, `vecLib' on Mac OS X).  The correct
incantation for these is usually found _via_ `--with-blas' with no
value on the appropriate platforms.

   Some of the external BLASes are multi-threaded.  One issue is that R
profiling (which uses the `SIGPROF' signal) may cause problems, and you
may want to disable profiling if you use a multi-threaded BLAS.  Note
that using a multi-threaded BLAS can result in taking more CPU time and
even more elapsed time (occasionally dramatically so) than using a
similar single-threaded BLAS.

   Note that under Unix (but not under Windows) if R is compiled against
a non-default BLAS and `--enable-BLAS-shlib' is *not* used, then all
BLAS-using packages must also be.  So if R is re-built to use an
enhanced BLAS then packages such as *quantreg* will need to be
re-installed.

A.3.1.1 ATLAS
.............

ATLAS (`http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/') is a "tuned" BLAS that
runs on a wide range of Unix-alike platforms.  Unfortunately it is
usually built as a static library that on some platforms cannot be used
with shared libraries such as are used in R packages.  Be careful when
using pre-built versions of ATLAS (they seem to work on `ix86'
platforms, but not on `x86_64' ones).

   The usual way to specify ATLAS will be via

     --with-blas="-lf77blas -latlas"

if the libraries are in the library path, otherwise by

     --with-blas="-L/path/to/ATLAS/libs -lf77blas -latlas"

For systems with multiple processors it is possible to use a
multi-threaded version of ATLAS, by specifying

     --with-blas="-lptf77blas -lpthread -latlas"

   Consult its file `INSTALL.txt' for how to build ATLAS with
position-independent code (at least on version 3.8.0 and later): this
also describes how to build ATLAS as a shared library.

   ATLAS can also be used on Windows: see *note Getting the source
files:: when building from source, and R Windows FAQ
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/bin/windows/rw-FAQ.html) for adding
pre-compiled support to binary versions.

A.3.1.2 ACML
............

For `x86_64' and `i686' processors under Linux and Solaris 10 there is
the AMD Core Math Library (ACML) `http://www.amd.com/acml'.  For the
`gcc' version we could use

     --with-blas="-lacml"

if the appropriate library directory (such as `/opt/acml4.3.0/gfortran64/lib')
is in the `LD_LIBRRARY_PATH'.  For other compilers, see the ACML
documentation.  There is a multithreaded Linux version of ACML
available for `gfortran' which needs `gcc' >= 4.2.0 (or some RedHat
versions of 4.1.x).  To make use of this you will need something like

     --with-blas="-L/opt/acml4.3.0/gfortran64_mp/lib -lacml_mp"

   See *note Shared BLAS:: for an alternative (and in many ways
preferable) way to use ACML.


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Goto BLAS,  Next: MKL,  Prev: ACML,  Up: BLAS

A.3.1.3 Goto BLAS
.................

Dr Kazushige Goto has written another tuned BLAS which is available for
several processors and OSes.

   This has been made available in several formats, but is currently
available only as source code.  For _academic use only_ (after
registering) it can be obtained via
`http://www.tacc.utexas.edu/resources/software/software.php'.  Once
this is built and installed, it can be used by configuring with

     --with-blas="-lgoto"

   See *note Shared BLAS:: for an alternative (and in many ways
preferable) way to use recent versions of the Goto BLAS.

   Note that currently a multi-threaded Goto BLAS will be built by
default if and only if the building is on a multi-processor system
(counting multiple cores and hyperthreading), and at run time the
default number of threads is the number of CPUs detected.

   It has been reported that on some RedHat-based Linux systems it is
necessary to set `GOTO_NUM_THREADS=1' or `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1' (to
disable multiple threads) in the environment when using a
multi-threaded Goto BLAS, but ours run happily with multiple threads.

A.3.1.4 Intel MKL
.................

For Intel processors under Linux, there is Intel's Math Kernel Library
(`http://www.intel.com/software/products/mkl/').  You are strongly
encouraged to read the MKL User's Guide, which is installed with the
library, before attempting to link to MKL.

   Version 10 of MKL supports two linking models: the default model,
which is backward compatible with version 9 (see below),  and the pure
layered model.  The layered model gives the user fine-grained control
over four different library layers: interface, threading, computation,
and run-time library support. Some examples of linking to MKL using this
layered model are given below. These examples are for GCC compilers on
`x86_64'.  The choice of interface layer is important on `x86_64' since
the Intel Fortran compiler returns complex values differently from the
GNU Fortran compiler. You must therefore use the interface layer that
matches your compiler (`mkl_intel*' or `mkl_gf*').

   R can be linked to a sequential version of MKL by

     MKL_LIB_PATH=/opt/intel/mkl/10.0.3.020/lib/em64t/
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$MKL_LIB_PATH
     MKL="-L${MKL_LIB_PATH} -lmkl_gf_lp64 -lmkl_sequential -lmkl_lapack -lmkl_core"
     ./configure --with-blas="$MKL" --with-lapack

The order of the libraries is important.  The option `--with-lapack' is
used since MKL contains a copy of LAPACK as well as BLAS (*note
LAPACK::).

   Threaded MKL may be used by replacing the line defining the variable
`MKL' with

     MKL="-L${MKL_LIB_PATH} -lmkl_gf_lp64 -lmkl_gnu_thread \
          -lmkl_lapack -lmkl_core -liomp5 -lpthread"

The default number of threads will be chosen by the OpenMP* software,
but can be controlled by setting `OMP_NUM_THREADS' or `MKL_NUM_THREADS'.

   Static MKL may be used with

     MKL="   -L${MKL_LIB_PATH}                               \
             -Wl,--start-group                               \
                     ${MKL_LIB_PATH}/libmkl_gf_lp64.a        \
                     ${MKL_LIB_PATH}/libmkl_gnu_thread.a     \
                     ${MKL_LIB_PATH}/libmkl_core.a           \
             -Wl,--end-group                                 \
             -lgomp -lpthread"

(Thanks to Ei-ji Nakama).

   The default linking model, which is also used by version 9 of MKL,
can be used by

     --with-blas="-lmkl -lguide -lpthread"

This is multi-threaded, but in version 9 the number of threads defaults
to 1.  It can be increased by setting `OMP_NUM_THREADS'.  (Thanks to
Andy Liaw for the information.)


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Shared BLAS,  Prev: MKL,  Up: BLAS

A.3.1.5 Shared BLAS
...................

Note that the BLAS library will be used for many of the add-on packages
as well as for R itself.  This means that it is better to use a
shared/dynamic BLAS library, as most of a static library will be
compiled into the R executable and each BLAS-using package.

   R offers the option of compiling the BLAS into a dynamic library
`libRblas' stored in `R_HOME/lib' and linking both R itself and all the
add-on packages against that library.

   This is the default on all platforms except AIX unless an external
BLAS is specified and found: for the latter it can be used by
specifying the option `--enable-BLAS-shlib', and it can always be
disabled via `--disable-BLAS-shlib'.

   This has both advantages and disadvantages.

   * It saves space by having only a single copy of the BLAS routines,
     which is helpful if there is an external static BLAS such as is
     standard for ATLAS.

   * There may be performance disadvantages in using a shared BLAS.
     Probably the most likely is when R's internal BLAS is used and R is
     _not_ built as a shared library, when it is possible to build the
     BLAS into `R.bin' (and `libR.a') without using
     position-independent code.  However, experiments showed that in
     many cases using a shared BLAS was as fast, provided high levels
     (e.g., `-O3') of compiler optimization are used.

   * It is easy to change the BLAS without making to re-install R and
     all the add-on packages, since all references to the BLAS go
     through `libRblas', and that can be replaced.  Note though that
     any dynamic libraries the replacement links to will need to be
     found by the linker: this may need the library path to be changed
     in `R_HOME/etc/ldpaths'.

   Another option to change the BLAS in use is to symlink a dynamic BLAS
library (such as ACML or Goto's) to `R_HOME/lib/libRblas.so'.  For
example, just

     mv R_HOME/lib/libRblas.so R_HOME/lib/libRblas.so.keep
     ln -s /opt/acml4.3.0/gfortran64_mp/lib/libacml_mp.so R_HOME/lib/libRblas.so

   will change the BLAS in use to multithreaded ACML.  A similar link
works for recent versions of the Goto BLAS and perhaps for MKL
(provided the appropriate `lib' directory is in the run-time library
path or `ld.so' cache).


File: R-admin.info,  Node: LAPACK,  Next: Caveats,  Prev: BLAS,  Up: Linear algebra

A.3.2 LAPACK
------------

Provision is made for using an external LAPACK library, principally to
cope with BLAS libraries which contain a copy of LAPACK (such as
`libsunperf' on Solaris, `vecLib' on Mac OS X and ACML on
`ix86'/`x86_64' Linux and Solaris).  However, the likely performance
gains are thought to be small (and may be negative), and the default is
not to search for a suitable LAPACK library, and this is definitely
*not* recommended.  You can specify a specific LAPACK library or a
search for a generic library by the configuration option
`--with-lapack'.  The default for `--with-lapack' is to check the BLAS
library and then look for an external library `-llapack'.  Sites
searching for the fastest possible linear algebra may want to build a
LAPACK library using the ATLAS-optimized subset of LAPACK.  To do so
specify something like

     --with-lapack="-L/path/to/libs -llapack -lcblas"

since the ATLAS subset of LAPACK depends on `libcblas'.  A value for
`--with-lapack' can be set _via_ the environment variable `LAPACK_LIBS',
but this will only be used if `--with-lapack' is specified (as the
default value is `no') and the BLAS library does not contain LAPACK.

   Since ACML contains a full LAPACK, if selected as the BLAS it can be
used as the LAPACK _via_ `--with-lapack'.

   If you do use `--with-lapack', be aware of potential problems with
bugs in the LAPACK 3.0 sources (or in the posted corrections to those
sources).  In particular, bugs in `DGEEV' and `DGESDD' have resulted in
error messages such as

     DGEBRD gave error code -10

(seen with the Debian `-llapack' which was current in late 2002, Fedora
Core 4 Extras `-llapack' in September 2005 and 64-bit `libsunperf' in
Forte 7).  Other potential problems are incomplete versions of the
libraries: for example `libsunperf' from Sun Forte 6.x was missing the
entry point for `DLANGE' and `vecLib' has omitted the BLAS routine
`LSAME'.  For problems compiling LAPACK using recent versions of `gcc'
on `ix86' Linux, see *Note New platforms::.

   Please *do* bear in mind that using `--with-lapack' is `definitely
*not* recommended': it is provided *only* because it is necessary on
some platforms.


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Caveats,  Prev: LAPACK,  Up: Linear algebra

A.3.3 Caveats
-------------

As with all libraries, you need to ensure that they and R were compiled
with compatible compilers and flags.  For example, this has meant that
on Sun Sparc using the native compilers the flag `-dalign' is needed so
`libsunperf' can be used.

   On some systems it is necessary that an external BLAS/LAPACK was
built with the same FORTRAN compiler used to build R: known problems are
with R built with `gfortran', *note Using gfortran::.

B.1 Configuration options
=========================

`configure' has many options: running

     ./configure --help

will give a list.  Probably the most important ones not covered
elsewhere are (defaults in brackets)

`--with-x'
     use the X Window System [yes]

`--x-includes=DIR'
     X include files are in DIR

`--x-libraries=DIR'
     X library files are in DIR

`--with-readline'
     use readline library (if available) [yes]

`--enable-R-profiling'
     attempt to compile support for `Rprof()' [yes]

`--enable-memory-profiling'
     attempt to compile support for `Rprofmem()' and `tracemem()' [no]

`--enable-R-shlib'
     build R as a shared/dynamic library [no]

`--enable-BLAS-shlib'
     build the BLAS as a shared/dynamic library [yes, except on AIX]

You can use `--without-foo' or `--disable-foo' for the negatives.

   You will want to use `--disable-R-profiling' if you are building a
profiled executable of R (e.g. with `-pg)'.

   Flag `--enable-R-shlib' causes the make process to build R as a
dynamic (shared) library, typically called `libR.so', and link the main
R executable `R.bin' against that library.  This can only be done if
all the code (including system libraries) can be compiled into a
dynamic library, and there may be a performance(1) penalty.  So you
probably only want this if you will be using an application which
embeds R.  Note that C code in packages installed on an R system linked
with `--enable-R-shlib' is linked against the dynamic library and so
such packages cannot be used from an R system built in the default way.
Also, because packages are linked against R they are on some OSes also
linked against the dynamic libraries R itself is linked against, and
this can lead to symbol conflicts.

   If you need to re-configure R with different options you may need to
run `make clean' or even `make distclean' before doing so.

B.2 Internationalization support
================================

Translation of messages is supported via GNU `gettext' unless disabled
by the configure option `--disable-nls' or the underlying OS has
insufficiently standard C functions to support it.  The `configure'
report will show `NLS' as one of the `Additional capabilities' if
support has been compiled in, and running in an English locale (but not
the `C' locale) will include

       Natural language support but running in an English locale

in the greeting on starting R.


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Configuration variables,  Next: Setting the shell,  Prev: Internationalization support,  Up: Configuration on Unix

B.3 Configuration variables
===========================

If you need or want to set certain configure variables to something
other than their default, you can do that by either editing the file
`config.site' (which documents many of the variables you might want to
set: others can be seen in file `etc/Renviron.in') or on the command
line as

     ./configure VAR=VALUE

If you are building in a directory different from the sources, there can
be copies of `config.site' in the source and the build directories, and
both will be read (in that order).  In addition, if there is a file
`~/.R/config' (or failing that(1) `~/.Rconfig'), it is read between the
`config.site' files in the source and the build directories.

   There is also a general `autoconf' mechanism for `config.site'
files, which are read before any of those mentioned in the previous
paragraph.  This looks first at a file specified by the environment
variable `CONFIG_SITE', and if not is set at files such as
`/usr/local/share/config.site' and `/usr/local/etc/config.site' in the
area (exemplified by `/usr/local' where R) would be installed.

   These variables are _precious_, implying that they do not have to be
exported to the environment, are kept in the cache even if not
specified on the command line and checked for consistency between two
configure runs (provided that caching is used), and are kept during
automatic reconfiguration as if having been passed as command line
arguments, even if no cache is used.

   See the variable output section of `configure --help' for a list of
all these variables.

   If you find you need to alter configure variables, it is worth noting
that some settings may be cached in the file `config.cache', and it is
a good idea to remove that file (if it exists) before re-configuring.
Note that caching is turned _off_ by default: use the command line
option `--config-cache' (or `-C') to enable caching.

File: R-admin.info,  Node: Setting paper size,  Next: Setting the browsers,  Prev: Configuration variables,  Up: Configuration variables

B.3.1 Setting paper size
------------------------

One common variable to change is `R_PAPERSIZE', which defaults to `a4',
not `letter'.  (Valid values are `a4', `letter', `legal' and
`executive'.)

   This is used both when configuring R to set the default, and when
running R to override the default.  It is also used to set the
papersize when making DVI and PDF manuals.

   The configure default will most often be `a4' if `R_PAPERSIZE' is
unset.  (If the (Debian Linux) program `paperconf' is found or the
environment variable `PAPERSIZE' is set, these are used to produce the
default.)

B.3.2 Setting the browsers
--------------------------

Another precious variable is `R_BROWSER', the default HTML browser,
which should take a value of an executable in the user's path or specify
a full path.

   Its counterpart for PDF files is  `R_PDFVIEWER'.


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Compilation flags,  Next: Making manuals,  Prev: Setting the browsers,  Up: Configuration variables

B.3.3 Compilation flags
-----------------------

If you have libraries and header files, e.g., for GNU readline, in
non-system directories, use the variables `LDFLAGS' (for libraries,
using `-L' flags to be passed to the linker) and `CPPFLAGS' (for header
files, using `-I' flags to be passed to the C/C++ preprocessors),
respectively, to specify these locations.  These default to
`-L/usr/local/lib' (`LDFLAGS', `-L/usr/local/lib64' on most 64-bit
Linux OSes) and `-I/usr/local/include' (`CPPFLAGS') to catch the most
common cases.  If libraries are still not found, then maybe your
compiler/linker does not support re-ordering of `-L' and `-l' flags
(this has been reported to be a problem on HP-UX with the native `cc').
In this case, use a different compiler (or a front end shell script
which does the re-ordering).

   These flags can also be used to build a faster-running version of R.
On most platforms using `gcc', having `-O3' in `CFLAGS' produces
worthwhile performance gains.  On systems using the GNU linker
(especially those using R as a shared library), it is likely that
including `-Wl,-O1' in `LDFLAGS' is worthwhile, and on recent systems
`'-Bdirect,--hash-style=both,-Wl,-O1'' is recommended at
`http://lwn.net/Articles/192624/'.  Tuning compilation to a specific
CPU family (e.g.  `-mtune=native' for `gcc') can give worthwhile
performance gains, especially on older architectures such as `ix86'.


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Making manuals,  Prev: Compilation flags,  Up: Configuration variables

B.3.4 Making manuals
--------------------

The default settings for making the manuals are controlled by
`R_RD4PDF', `R_RD4DVI' and `R_PAPERSIZE'.


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Setting the shell,  Next: Using make,  Prev: Configuration variables,  Up: Configuration on Unix

B.4 Setting the shell
=====================

By default the shell scripts such as `R' will be `#!/bin/sh' scripts
(or using the `SHELL' chosen by `configure').  This is almost always
satisfactory, but on a few systems `/bin/sh' is not a Bourne shell or
clone, and the shell to be used can be changed by setting the configure
variable `R_SHELL' to a suitable value (a full path to a shell, e.g.
`/usr/local/bin/bash').


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Using make,  Next: Using FORTRAN,  Prev: Setting the shell,  Up: Configuration on Unix

B.5 Using make
==============

To compile R, you will most likely find it easiest to use GNU `make',
although the Sun `make' works on Solaris.  The native `make' has been
reported to fail on SGI Irix 6.5 and Alpha/OSF1 (aka Tru64).

   To build in a separate directory you need a `make' that uses the
`VPATH' variable, for example GNU `make', or Sun `make' on Solaris 2.7
or later.

   `dmake' has also been used. e.g, on Solaris 10.

   If you want to use a `make' by another name, for example if your GNU
`make' is called `gmake', you need to set the variable `MAKE' at
configure time, for example

     ./configure MAKE=gmake

   Note the comment in *Note Installation:: about using a parallel
`make'.


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Using FORTRAN,  Next: Compile and load flags,  Prev: Using make,  Up: Configuration on Unix

B.6 Using FORTRAN
=================

* Menu:

* Using gfortran::

   To compile R, you need a FORTRAN compiler.  The default is to search
for `f95', `fort', `xlf95', `ifort', `ifc', `efc', `pgf95' `lf95',
`gfortran', `ftn', `g95', `f90', `xlf90', `pghpf', `pgf90', `epcf90',
`g77', `f77', `xlf', `frt', `pgf77', `cf77', `fort77', `fl32', `af77'
(in that order)(1), and use whichever is found first; if none is found,
R cannot be compiled.  However, if `CC' is `gcc', the matching FORTRAN
compiler (`g77' for `gcc' 3 and `gfortran' for `gcc' 4) is used if
available.

   The search mechanism can be changed using the configure variable
`F77' which specifies the command that runs the FORTRAN 77 compiler.
If your FORTRAN compiler is in a non-standard location, you should set
the environment variable `PATH' accordingly before running `configure',
or use the configure variable `F77' to specify its full path.

   If your FORTRAN libraries are in slightly peculiar places, you should also
look at `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' or your system's equivalent to make sure that
all libraries are on this path.

   Note that only FORTRAN compilers which convert identifiers to lower
case are supported.

   You must set whatever compilation flags (if any) are needed to ensure
that FORTRAN `integer' is equivalent to a C `int' pointer and FORTRAN
`double precision' is equivalent to a C `double' pointer.  This is
checked during the configuration process.

   Some of the FORTRAN code makes use of `COMPLEX*16' variables, which
is a Fortran 90 extension.  This is checked for at configure time(2),
but you may need to avoid compiler flags(3) asserting FORTRAN 77
compliance.

   For performance reasons(4) you may want to choose a FORTRAN 90/95
compiler.

   It is possible to use `f2c', the FORTRAN-to-C converter
(`http://www.netlib.org/f2c'), via a script.  (An example script is
given in `scripts/f77_f2c': this can be customized by setting the
environment variables `F2C', `F2CLIBS', `CC' and `CPP'.)  You may need
to ensure that the FORTRAN type `integer' is translated to the C type
`int'.  Normally `f2c.h' contains `typedef long int integer;', which
will work on a 32-bit platform but not on a 64-bit platform.  If your
compiler is not `gcc' you will need to set `FPICFLAGS' appropriately.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) On HP-UX `fort77' is the POSIX compliant FORTRAN compiler, and
comes after `g77'.

   (2) as well as its equivalence to the `Rcomplex' structure defined
in `R_ext/Complex.h'.

error messages.

   (4) e.g., to use an optimized BLAS on Sun/Sparc


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Using gfortran,  Prev: Using FORTRAN,  Up: Using FORTRAN

B.6.1 Using gfortran
--------------------

`gfortran' is the F95 compiler that is part of `gcc' 4.X.Y.  There were
problems compiling R with the first release (`gcc' 4.0.0) and more with
pre-releases, but these are resolved in later versions.

   On Linux `x86_64' systems there is an incompatibility in the return
conventions for double-complex functions between `gfortran' and `g77'
which results in the final example in `example(eigen)' hanging or
segfaulting under external BLASs built under `g77'.  This should be
detected by a `configure' test.

   The default `FFLAGS' chosen (by `autoconf') for a GNU FORTRAN
compiler is `-g -O2'.  This seems not to be documented for `gfortran',
and has caused problems (segfaults and infinite loops) on `x86_64'
Linux (and the optimizer will be shared with other platforms on that
CPU type).  A maximum optimization of `-O' is recommended there.


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Compile and load flags,  Prev: Using FORTRAN,  Up: Configuration on Unix

B.7 Compile and load flags
==========================

A wide range of flags can be set in the file `config.site' or as
configure variables on the command line.  We have already mentioned

`CPPFLAGS'
     header file search directory (`-I') and any other miscellaneous
     options for the C and C++ preprocessors and compilers

`LDFLAGS'
     path (`-L'), stripping (`-s') and any other miscellaneous options
     for the linker

and others include

`CFLAGS'
     debugging and optimization flags, C

`MAIN_CFLAGS'
     ditto, for compiling the main program

`SHLIB_CFLAGS'
     for shared libraries

`FFLAGS'
     debugging and optimization flags, FORTRAN

`SAFE_FFLAGS'
     ditto for source files which need exact floating point behaviour

`MAIN_FFLAGS'
     ditto, for compiling the main program

`SHLIB_FFLAGS'
     for shared libraries

`MAIN_LDFLAGS'
     additional flags for the main link

`SHLIB_LDFLAGS'
     additional flags for linking the shared libraries

`LIBnn'
     the primary library directory, `lib' or `lib64'

`CPICFLAGS'
     special flags for compiling C code to be turned into a shared
     library

`FPICFLAGS'
     special flags for compiling Fortran code to be turned into a
     shared library

`CXXPICFLAGS'
     special flags for compiling C++ code to be turned into a shared
     library

`FCPICFLAGS'
     special flags for compiling Fortran 95 code to be turned into a
     shared library

`DEFS'
     defines to be used when compiling C code in R itself

Library paths specified as `-L/lib/path' in `LDFLAGS' are collected
together and prepended to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' (or your system's
equivalent), so there should be no need for `-R' or `-rpath' flags.

   Variables such as `CPICFLAGS' are determined where possible by
`configure'.  Some systems allows two types of PIC flags, for example
`-fpic' and `-fPIC', and if they differ the first allows only a limited
number of symbols in a shared library.  Since R as a shared library has
about 6200 symbols, if in doubt use the larger version.

   To compile a profiling version of R, one might for example want to
use `MAIN_CFLAGS=-pg', `MAIN_FFLAGS=-pg', `MAIN_LDFLAGS=-pg' on
platforms where `-pg' cannot be used with position-independent code.

   *Beware*: it may be necessary to set `CFLAGS' and `FFLAGS' in ways
compatible with the libraries to be used: one possible issue is the
alignment of doubles, another is the way structures are passed.

   On some platforms `configure' will select additional flags for
`CFLAGS', `CPPFLAGS', `FFLAGS', `CXXFLAGS' and `LIBS' in
`R_XTRA_CFLAGS' (and so on).  These are for options which are always
required, for example to force IEC 60559 compliance.

Appendix C Platform notes
*************************

This section provides some notes on building R on different Unix-like
platforms.  These notes are based on tests run on one or two systems in
each case with particular sets of compilers and support libraries.
Success in building R depends on the proper installation and functioning
of support software; your results may differ if you have other versions
of compilers and support libraries.

   Older versions of this manual (for R < 2.10.0) contain notes on
platforms such as HP-UX, IRIX and Alpha/OSF1 for which we have had no
recent reports.

File: R-admin.info,  Node: X11 issues,  Next: Linux,  Prev: Platform notes,  Up: Platform notes

C.1 X11 issues
==============

The `X11()' graphics device is the one started automatically on
Unix-alikes when plotting.  As its name implies, it displays on a (local
or remote) X server, and relies on the services and in particular the
fonts provided by the X server.  So if you sometimes use R at a console
and sometimes remotely from an X11 session running on a Windows
machine, you may have to setup the fonts differently for the two usages.

   The `modern' version of the `X11()' device is based on `cairo'
graphics and uses `fontconfig' to pick and render fonts.  This is done
on the server, and although there can be selection issues, they are
more amenable than the issues with `X11()' discussed in the rest of
this section.

   When X11 was designed, most displays were around 75dpi, whereas today
they are of the order of 100dpi or even higher.  If you find that X11()
is reporting(1) missing font sizes, especially larger ones, it is likely
that you are not using scalable fonts and have not installed the 100dpi
versions of the X11 fonts.  The names and details differ by system, but
will likely have something like Fedora's
     xorg-x11-fonts-75dpi
     xorg-x11-fonts-100dpi
     xorg-x11-fonts-truetype
     xorg-x11-fonts-Type1
     xorg-x11-fonts-cyrillic

and you need to ensure that the `-100dpi' versions are installed and on
the X11 font path (check via `xset -q').  The `X11()' device does try
to set a pointsize and not a pixel size: laptop users may find the
default setting of 12 too large (although very frequently laptop
screens are set to a fictitious dpi to appear like a scaled-down
desktop screen).

   More complicated problems can occur in non-Western-European locales,
so if you are using one, the first thing to check is that things work in
the `C' locale.  The likely issues are a failure to find any fonts or
glyphs being rendered incorrectly (often as a pair of ASCII
characters).  X11 works by being asked for a font specification and
coming up with its idea of a close match.  For text (as distinct from
the symbols used by plotmath), the specification is the first element of
the option `"X11fonts"' which defaults to

     "-adobe-helvetica-%s-%s-*-*-%d-*-*-*-*-*-*-*"

   If you are using a single-byte encoding, for example ISO 8859-2 in
Eastern Europe or KOI8-R in Russian, use `xlsfonts' to find an
appropriate family of fonts in your encoding (the last field in the
listing).  If you find none, it is likely that you need to install
further font packages, such as `xorg-x11-fonts-cyrillic' shown in the
listing above.

   Multi-byte encodings (most commonly UTF-8) are even more complicated.
There are few fonts in `iso10646-1', the Unicode encoding, and they
only contain a subset of the available glyphs (and are often fixed-width
designed for use in terminals).  In such locales _fontsets_ are used,
made up of fonts encoded in other encodings.  If the locale you are
using has an entry in the `XLC_LOCALE' directory (typically
`/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/locale', it is likely that all you need to do is to
pick a suitable font specification that has fonts in the encodings
specified there.  If not, you may have to get hold of a suitable locale
entry for X11.  This may mean that, for example, Japanese text can be
displayed when running in `ja_JP.utf8' but not when running in
`en_GB.utf8' on the same machine (although on some systems many UTF-8
X11 locales are aliased to `en_US.utf8' which covers several character
sets, e.g. ISO 8859-1 (Western European), JISX0208 (Kanji), KSC5601
(Korean), GB2312 (Chinese Han) and JISX0201 (Kana)).

   On some systems scalable fonts are available covering a wide range of
glyphs.  One source is TrueType fonts, and these can provide high
coverage.  Another is Type 1 fonts: the URW set of Type 1 fonts provides
standard typefaces such as Helvetica with a larger coverage of Unicode
glyphs than the standard X11 bitmaps, including Cyrillic.  These are
generally not part of the default install, and the X server may need to
be configured to use them.  They might be under the X11 `fonts'
directory or elsewhere, for example,

     /usr/share/fonts/default/Type1
     /usr/share/fonts/ja/TrueType

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) for example, `X11 font at size 14 could not be loaded'.

C.2 Linux
=========

Linux is the main development platform for R, so compilation from the
sources is normally straightforward with the standard compilers.

   Remember that some package management systems (such as RPM and deb)
make a distinction between the user version of a package and the
developer version.  The latter usually has the same name but with the
extension `-devel' or `-dev': you need both versions installed.  So
please check the `configure' output to see if the expected features are
detected: if for example `readline' is missing add the developer
package.  (On most systems you will also need `ncurses' and its
developer package, although these should be dependencies of the
`readline' package(s).)

   When R has been installed from a binary distribution there are
sometimes problems with missing components such as the FORTRAN
compiler.  Searching the `R-help' archives will normally reveal what is
needed.

   It seems that `ix86' Linux accepts non-PIC code in shared libraries,
but this is not necessarily so on other platforms, in particular for
64-bit CPUs such as `x86_64'.  So care can be needed with BLAS
libraries and when building R as a shared library to ensure that
position-independent code is used in any static libraries (such as the
Tcl/Tk libraries, `libpng', `libjpeg' and `zlib') which might be linked
against.  Fortunately these are normally built as shared libraries with
the exception of the ATLAS BLAS libraries.

   For platforms with both 64- and 32-bit support, it is likely that

     LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib64 -L/usr/local/lib"

is appropriate since most (but not all) software installs its 64-bit
libraries in `/usr/local/lib64'.  To build a 32-bit version of R on
`x86_64' with Fedora 8 we used

     CC="gcc -m32"
     CXX="g++ -m32"
     F77="gfortran -m32"
     FC=${F77}
     OBJC=${CC}
     LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib"
     LIBnn=lib

   64-bit versions of Linux are built with support for files > 2Gb, and
32-bit versions will be if possible unless `--disable-largefile' is
specified.

   There are known problems with several early versions of `gcc' 4, but
`gcc' 4.1.0 and later have been tested extensively.

   To build a 64-bit version of R on `ppc64' (also known as
`powerpc64') with `gcc' 4.1.1, Ei-ji Nakama used

     CC="gcc -m64"
     CXX="gxx -m64"
     F77="gfortran -m64"
     FC="gfortran -m64"
     CFLAGS="-mminimal-toc -fno-optimize-sibling-calls -g -O2"
     FFLAGS="-mminimal-toc -fno-optimize-sibling-calls -g -O2"

the additional flags being needed to resolve problems linking against
`libnmath.a' and when linking R as a shared library.

C.2.1 Intel compilers
---------------------

Intel compilers have been used under `ix86' and `x86_64' Linux and R
contains code to set the FPU options suitably.  Brian Ripley tried
version 9.0 of the compilers for `ix86' on Fedora Core 3 _via_

     CC=icc
     F77=ifort
     CXX=icpc
     ICC_LIBS=/opt/compilers/intel/cc/9.0/lib
     IFC_LIBS=/opt/compilers/intel/fc/9.0/lib
     LDFLAGS="-L$ICC_LIBS -L$IFC_LIBS -L/usr/local/lib"
     SHLIB_CXXLD=icpc

and adding optimization flags failed: at least `src/main/regex.c' and
`src/modules/lapack/dlamc.f' needed to be compiled without
optimization.  For `x86_64' on Fedora Core 5 he used

     CC=icc
     CFLAGS="-g -O3 -wd188 -ip"
     F77=ifort
     FLAGS="-g -O3"
     CXX=icpc
     CXXFLAGS="-g -O3"
     FC=ifort
     FCFLAGS="-g -O3 -mp"
     ICC_LIBS=/opt/compilers/intel/cce/9.1.039/lib
     IFC_LIBS=/opt/compilers/intel/fce/9.1.033/lib
     LDFLAGS="-L$ICC_LIBS -L$IFC_LIBS -L/usr/local/lib64"
     SHLIB_CXXLD=icpc

`configure' will add `-c99' to `CC' for C99-compliance.  This causes
warnings with `icc' 10, so use `CC="icc -std=c99"' there.  R will add
`-mp' in `R_XTRA_{C,F,CXX}FLAGS' to maintain correct IEC 60559
arithmetic.  The flag `-wd188' suppresses a large number of warnings
about the enumeration type `Rboolean'.  Because the Intel C compiler
sets `__GNUC__' without complete emulation of `gcc', we suggest adding
`CPPFLAGS=-no-gcc'.

   For some comments on building on an Itanium (`ia64') Linux system
with `gcc' or the Intel compilers see
`http://www.nakama.ne.jp/memo/ia64_linux/'.

   Others have reported success with version 10.0.

C.2.2 PGI compilers
-------------------

Jennifer Lai used the Portland Group compilers on `x86_64' to build
pre-2.2.0.  Updated versions of the settings she used are

     PG_HOME=/usr/pgi/linux86-64/6.0
     CC=pgcc
     CFLAGS="-g -O2 -Kieee"
     CPPFLAGS="-I$PG_HOME/include -I$PG_HOME/include/CC"
     F77=pgf77
     FFLAGS="-g -O2 -Kieee"
     CXX=pgCC
     CXXFLAGS="-g -O2 -Kieee"
     FC=pgf95
     FCFLAGS="-g -O2 -Kieee"
     SHLIB_CXXLDFLAGS=-shared
     SHLIB_LDFLAGS=-shared
     LDFLAGS="-L$PG_HOME/libso -L/usr/lib64"

Note particularly the last, which is needed to ensure that a shared
version of `libc' is found.  The flag `-Kieee' ensures strict
compliance to IEC60659.  Also,
`http://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content_type/DownloadableAssets/dwamd_PGI_nov603.pdf'
suggests that `-pc64' may be desirable.

`-m64' could be added, but was the default.  Do not use `-fast': see
the warnings under Solaris.

   The resulting build of R was not quite as fast as that built with
`gcc' 4.3.2 at `-O3'.

C.3 FreeBSD
===========

Rainer Hurling has reported success on `x86_64' FreeBSD 7.2 (and on 6.x
in the past).  Since Darwin (the base OS of Mac OS X) is based on
FreeBSD we find testing on Darwin tends to pick up any potential
problems on FreeBSD problems quite early.

   The native BSD `make' suffices to build R but a number of packages
require GNU `make'.  (The BSD version is `bsdmake' on Darwin.)

C.4 Mac OS X
============

You can build R as a Unix application on Mac OS X using the Apple
Developer Tools (`Xcode') and `gfortran'.  You will also need to
install an X sub-system or configure with `--without-x'.  The X window
manager is part of the standard Mac OS X distribution since Mac OS X
version 10.3 (Panther), but it is typically not pre-installed prior to
10.5 (Leopard).

   For more information on how to find these tools please read the R
for Mac OS X FAQ
(http://CRAN.R-project.org/bin/macosx/RMacOSX-FAQ.html).

   The `vecLib' library can be used _via_ the (default) configuration
options

     --with-blas="-framework vecLib" --with-lapack

to provide higher-performance versions of the BLAS and LAPACK routines.
Building R without these options _via_

     --without-blas --without-lapack

can be done (and is provided as an alternative in the binary
distribution).

C.4.1 64-bit builds
-------------------

64-bit builds are supported on 10.5.x (Leopard) and later.  All that is
needed is to select suitable compiler options, e.g. for recent Intel
Macs

     CC='gcc -arch x86_64'
     CXX='g++ -arch x86_64'
     F77='gfortran -arch x86_64'
     FC='gfortran -arch x86_64'
     OBJC='gcc -arch x86_64'

in `config.site' or on the `configure' command line.  (Or on Leopard
specify `gcc-4.2' etc: those versions are the default on Snow Leopard.)


File: R-admin.info,  Node: Snow Leopard,  Prev: 64-bit builds,  Up: Mac OS X

C.4.2 Snow Leopard
------------------

On Snow Leopard you will most likely to need to specify `-arch i386'
for a 32-bit build and `-arch x86_64' for a 64-bit build: the Apple
compilers default to 64-bit but the `gfortran' supplied on CRAN
defaults to 32-bit.

   `gcc-4.2' is the default compiler, and is best matched with
`gfortran-4.2' from the R Mac OS X distribution.

   Another quirk is that people have found that the X11 libraries are
not in the default linking path, so something like
`LIBS=-L/usr/X11/lib' may be required.

C.5 Solaris
===========

R has been built successfully on Solaris 10 (both Sparc and `x86')
using the (zero cost) Sun Studio (aka Ceres) 12 compilers: there has
been some success with `gcc' 4/`gfortran', mainly on Sparc.  Sun
packages for R are available from `http://www.sunfreeware.com/' for both
architectures, but have not been updated recently.  (Recent Sun machines
are Opterons (`amd64') rather than `x86', but 32-bit `x86' executables
are the default.)

   There are also reports of success on OpenSolaris (also known as
Solaris Express Community Edition, and sometimes as Solaris 11) on
`x86'.

   The Solaris versions of several of the tools needed to build R (e.g.
`make', `ar' and `ld') are in `/usr/ccs/bin', so if using those tools
ensure this is in your path.

   Modern Solaris systems allow a large selection of Open Source
software to be installed from `http://www.opencsw.org' (formerly
`http://www.blastwave.org') via `pkg-get', by default installed under
`/opt/csw'.  You will need GNU `libiconv' and `readline': the Solaris
version of `iconv' is not sufficiently powerful.

   Some people have reported that the Solaris `libintl' needs to be
avoided, for example by using `--disable-nls' or
`--with-included-gettext' or using `libintl' from OpenCSW.

   If using `gcc', do ensure that the compiler was compiled for the
version of Solaris in use.  (This can be ascertained from `gcc -v'.)
`gcc' makes modified versions of some header files, and several reports
of problems were due to using `gcc' compiled on one version of Solaris
on a later version.  A version of `gcc' optimized for Sparc (using
technology from Sun's compilers) is available from Sun.(1)

   When using the Sun compilers(2) do _not_ specify `-fast', as this
disables IEEE arithmetic and `make check' will fail.

   For the Sun Studio compilers a little juggling of paths was needed to
ensure GNU `libiconv' is used rather than the Solaris `iconv': at one
time we used

     CC="cc -xc99"
     CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/csw/include
     CFLAGS="-O -xlibmieee"
     F77=f95
     FFLAGS=-O4
     CXX=CC
     CXXFLAGS=-O
     FC=f95
     FCFLAGS=$FFLAGS
     LDFLAGS=-L/opt/csw/lib
     SHLIB_CXXLDFLAGS="-G -lCstd"

to ensure that the `libiconv' version of `iconv.h' was found, and later
used self-compiled versions of `libiconv' and `readline' from
`/usr/local' (replacing `/opt/csw' in the flags).  For a 64-bit target
add `-m64' and use something like `LDFLAGS=-L/opt/csw/lib/sparcv9' or
`LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib/amd64' as appropriate.

   By default the Sun Studio compilers do not conform to the C99
standard (appendix F 8.9) on the return values of functions such as
`log': use `-xlibmieee' to ensure this.  Also, errors have been reported
on `amd64' if `-xc99' is omitted.

   You can target specific Sparc architectures for (slightly) higher
performance: Sun recommend

     32-bit: -xtarget=ultra3 -xarch=v8plusa
     64-bit: -xtarget=ultra3 -xarch=v9a

(in `CFLAGS' etc.) as a good compromise for recent Sparc chipsets.

   On `x86' you will get marginally higher performance _via_

     CFLAGS="-xO5 -xc99 -xlibmieee -xlibmil -nofstore"
     FFLAGS="-O5 -libmil -nofstore"
     CXXFLAGS="-xO5 -xlibmil -nofstore"
     SAFE_FFLAGS="-O5 -libmil -fstore"

   Compilation for a 32-bit Sparc target with `gcc' 4 (`gcc' 4.3.3 but
`gfortran' 4.0.2) needed

     CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/csw/include
     FPICFLAGS=-fPIC
     FCPICFLAGS=-fPIC
     LDFLAGS="-L/opt/csw/gcc4/lib -L/opt/csw/lib"

and for a 64-bit Sparc target
     CC="gcc -m64"
     CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/csw/include
     F77="gfortran -m64"
     FPICFLAGS=-fPIC
     CXX="g++ -m64"
     FC="gfortran -m64"
     FCPICFLAGS=-fPIC
     LDFLAGS="-L/opt/csw/gcc4/lib/sparcv9 -L/opt/csw/lib/sparcv9"

Note that paths such as `/opt/csw/gcc4/lib/sparcv9' may need to be in
the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' during configuration.

   Tests with `gcc' on `x86' and `amd64' have been less successful:
`x86' builds have failed on tests using complex arithmetic(3), whereas
on `amd64' the builds have failed to complete in several different ways.

   The Sun performance library `libsunperf' is available for use with
the Sun Studio compilers.  If selected as a BLAS, it must also be
selected as LAPACK via

     ./configure --with-blas=sunperf --with-lapack

However, our tests were none too successful.  Sparc 32-bit builds
worked, but 64-bit Sparc builds failed in `example(eigen)', and `x86'
builds failed in `example(bw.SJ)'.

C.6 AIX
=======

We no longer support AIX prior to 4.2, and `configure' will throw an
error on such systems.

   Ei-ji Nakama was able to build under AIX 5.2 on `powerpc' with GCC
4.0.3 in several configurations.  32-bit bit versions could be
configured with `--without-iconv' as well as `--enable-R-shlib'.  For
64-bit versions he used

     OBJECT_MODE=64
     CC="gcc -maix64"
     CXX="g++ -maix64"
     F77="gfortran -maix64"
     FC="gfortran -maix64"

and was also able to build with the IBM `xlc' and Hitachi `f90'
compilers by

     OBJECT_MODE=64
     CC="xlc -q64"
     CXX="g++ -maix64"
     F77="f90 -cpu=pwr4 -hf77 -parallel=0 -i,L -O3 -64"
     FC="f90 -cpu=pwr4 -hf77 -parallel=0 -i,L -O3 -64"
     FLIBS="-L/opt/ofort90/lib -lhf90vecmath -lhf90math -lf90"

   Some systems have `f95' as an IBM compiler that does not by default
accept FORTRAN 77.  It needs the flag `-qfixed=72', or to be invoked as
`xlf_r'.

   The AIX native `iconv' does not support encodings `latin1' nor `""'
and so cannot be used.  (As far as we know GNU `libiconv' could be
installed.)

   Fan Long reports success on AIX 5.3 using

     OBJECT_MODE=64
     LIBICONV=/WHERE/LIBICONV/INSTALLED
     CC="xlc_r -q64"
     CFLAGS="-O -qstrict"
     CXX="xlC_r -q64"
     CXXFLAGS="-O -qstrict"
     F77="xlf_r -q64"
     AR="ar -X64"
     CPPFLAGS="-I$LIBICONV/include -I/usr/lpp/X11/include/X11"
     LDFLAGS="-L$LIBICONV/lib -L/usr/lib -L/usr/X11R6/lib"

   On one AIX 6.x system it was necessary to use `R_SHELL' to set the
default shell to be Bash rather than Zsh.

   Kurt Hornik and Stefan Theussl at WU (Wirtschaftsuniversitt Wien)
successfully built R on a `powerpc' (8-CPU Power6 system) on AIX 6.1,
configuring with or without `--enable-R-shlib' (Ei-ji Nakama's support
is gratefully acknowledged).

   It helps to describe the WU build environment first.  A small part of
the software needed to build R and/or install packages is available
directly from the AIX Installation DVDs, e.g., Java 6, X11, and Perl.
Additional open source software (OSS) is packaged for AIX in `.rpm'
files and available from both IBM's "AIX Toolbox for Linux Applications"
(`http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/power/software/aix/linux/') and
`http://www.oss4aix.org/download/'.  The latter website typically
offers more recent versions of the available OSS.  All tools needed and
libraries downloaded from these repositories (e.g., GCC, Make,
`libreadline', etc.) are typically installed to `/opt/freeware', hence
corresponding executables are found in `/opt/freeware/bin' which thus
needs to be in `PATH' for using these tools.  Like on other Unix
systems one needs GNU `libiconv' as the AIX version of iconv is not
sufficiently powerful.  Additionally, for proper Unicode compatibility
one should install the corresponding package from the ICU project
(`http://www.icu-project.org/download/'), which offers pre-compiled
binaries for various platforms which in case of AIX can be installed via
unpacking the tarball to the root file system.  For full LaTeX support
one can install the TeX Live DVD distribution
(`http://www.tug.org/texlive/'): it is recommended to update the
distribution using the `tlmgr' update manager.  For 64-bit R builds
supporting Tcl/Tk this needs to installed from the sources as available
pre-compiled binaries supply only 32-bit shared objects.

   The recent WU testing was done using compilers from both the GNU
Compiler Collection (version 4.2.4) which is available from one of the
above OSS repositories, and the IBM C/C++ (XL C/C++ 10.01) as well as
FORTRAN (XL Fortran 12.01) compilers
(`http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/download/byproduct.jsp#X').

   To compile for a 64-bit `powerpc' (Power6 CPU) target one can use

     CC ="gcc -maix64 -pthread"
     CXX="g++ -maix64 -pthread"
     FC="gfortran -maix64 -pthread"
     F77="gfortran -maix64 -pthread"
     CFLAGS="-O2 -g -mcpu=power6"
     FFLAGS="-O2 -g -mcpu=power6"
     FCFLAGS="-O2 -g -mcpu=power6"

for the GCC and

     CC=xlc
     CXX=xlc++
     FC=xlf
     F77=xlf
     CFLAGS="-qarch=auto -qcache=auto -qtune=auto -O3 -qstrict -ma"
     FFLAGS="-qarch=auto -qcache=auto -qtune=auto -O3 -qstrict"
     FCFLAGS="-qarch=auto -qcache=auto -qtune=auto -O3 -qstrict"
     CXXFLAGS="-qarch=auto -qcache=auto -qtune=auto -O3 -qstrict"

for the IBM XL compilers.  For the latter, it is important to note that
the decision for generating 32-bit or 64-bit code is done by setting the `OBJECT_MODE'
environment variable appropriately (recommended) or using an additional
compiler flag (`-q32' or `-q64').  By default the IBM XL compilers
produce 32 bit code.  Thus, to build R with 64-bit support one needs to
either export `OBJECT_MODE=64' in the environment or, alternatively,
use the `-q64' compiler options.

   It is strongly recommended to install Bash and use it as the
configure shell, e.g., via setting `CONFIG_SHELL=/usr/bin/bash' in the
environment, and to use GNU Make (e.g., via
(`MAKE=/opt/freeware/bin/make').

   Further installation instructions to set up a proper R development
environment can be found in the "R on AIX" project on R-Forge
(`http://R-Forge.R-project.org/projects/aix/').

C.7 Cygwin
==========

The Cygwin emulation layer on Windows can be treated as a Unix-alike OS.
This is unsupported, but experiments have been conducted and a few
workarounds added for R 2.6.0.

   Only building as a shared library works,(1) so use e.g

     ./configure --disable-nls --enable-R-shlib
     make

NLS does work if required, although adding `--with-included-gettext' is
preferable.  You will see many warnings about the use of auto-import.

   Note that this gives you a command-line application using `readline'
for command editing.  The `X11' graphics device will work if a suitable
X server is running, and the standard Unix-alike ways of installing
source packages work.  There was a bug in the `/usr/lib/tkConfig.sh'
script in the version we looked at, which needs to have

     TK_LIB_SPEC='-ltk84'

   The overhead of using shell scripts makes this noticeably slower
than a native build of R on Windows.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) Windows DLLs need to have all links resolved at build time and
so cannot resolve against `R.bin'.


File: R-admin.info,  Node: New platforms,  Prev: Cygwin,  Up: Platform notes

C.8 New platforms
=================

There are a number of sources of problems when installing R on a new
hardware/OS platform.  These include

   *Floating Point Arithmetic*: R requires arithmetic compliant with
IEC 60559, also know as IEEE 754.  This mandates the use of plus and
minus infinity and `NaN' (not a number) as well as specific details of
rounding.  Although almost all current FPUs can support this, selecting
such support can be a pain.  The problem is that there is no agreement
on how to set the signalling behaviour; Sun/Sparc, SGI/IRIX and `ix86'
Linux require no special action, FreeBSD requires a call to (the macro)
`fpsetmask(0)' and OSF1 requires that computation be done with a
`-ieee_with_inexact' flag etc.  On a new platform you must find out the
magic recipe and add some code to make it work.  This can often be done
via the file `config.site' which resides in the top level directory.

   Beware of using high levels of optimization, at least initially.  On
many compilers these reduce the degree of compliance to the IEEE model.
For example, using `-fast' on the Solaris SunPro compilers causes R's
`NaN' to be set incorrectly.

   *Shared Libraries*: There seems to be very little agreement across
platforms on what needs to be done to build shared libraries.  there
are many different combinations of flags for the compilers and loaders.
GNU libtool cannot be used (yet), as it currently does not fully
support FORTRAN: one would need a shell wrapper for this).  The
technique we use is to first interrogate the X window system about what
it does (using `xmkmf'), and then override this in situations where we
know better (for tools from the GNU Compiler Collection and/or
platforms we know about).  This typically works, but you may have to
manually override the results.  Scanning the manual entries for `cc'
and `ld' usually reveals the correct incantation.  Once you know the
recipe you can modify the file `config.site' (following the
instructions therein) so that the build will use these options.

   It seems that `gcc' 3.4.x and later on `ix86' Linux defeat attempts
by the LAPACK code to avoid computations entirely in extended-precision
registers, so file `src/modules/lapack/dlamc.f' may need to be compiled
without optimization.  Set the configure variable `SAFE_FFLAGS' to the
flags to be used for this file.  If configure detects GNU FORTRAN it
adds flag `-ffloat-store' to `FFLAGS'.  (Other settings are needed when
using `icc' on `ix86' Linux, for example.)

   If you do manage to get R running on a new platform please let us
know about it so we can modify the configuration procedures to include
that platform.

   If you are having trouble getting R to work on your platform please
feel free to use the `R-devel' mailing list to ask questions.  We have
had a fair amount of practice at porting R to new platforms ....

Appendix D The Windows toolset
******************************

If you want to build R or add-on packages from source in Windows, you
will need to collect, install and test an extensive set of tools.  See
`http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/' for the current locations
and other updates to these instructions.  (Most Windows users will not
need to build add-on packages from source; see *Note Add-on packages::
for details.)

   Only building with MinGW `gcc 4.2.1' is supported, and that compiler
set works out-of-the-box on Windows Vista.

   We have found that the build process for R is quite sensitive to the
choice of tools: please follow our instructions *exactly*, even to the
choice of particular versions of the tools.(1)  The build process for
add-on packages is somewhat more forgiving, but we recommend using the
exact toolset at first, and only substituting other tools once you are
familiar with the process.

   _This appendix contains a lot of prescriptive comments.  They are
here as a result of bitter experience.  Please do not report problems to
the R mailing lists unless you have followed all the prescriptions._

   We have collected most of the necessary tools (unfortunately not all,
due to license or size limitations) into an executable installer named
`Rtools.exe', available from
`http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/'. You should download and
run it, choosing the default "Package authoring installation" to build
add-on packages, or the "full installation" if you intend to build R.

   You will need the following items to build R and packages.  See the
subsections below for detailed descriptions.
   * Perl (in `Rtools.exe')

   * The command line tools (in `Rtools.exe')

   * The MinGW compilers (in `Rtools.exe')
   For installing simple packages containing data or R source but no
compiled code, none of these are needed.  Perl is essential to build R,
and needed to develop packages.

   A complete build of R including compiled HTML help files and PDF
manuals, and producing the standalone installer `R-2.10.1-win32.exe'
will also need the following:
   * LaTeX

   * The Inno Setup installer

   It is important to set your `PATH' properly.  The `Rtools.exe'
optionally sets the path to components that it installs.

   Your `PATH' may include `.' first, then the `bin' directories of the
tools, Perl, MinGW and LaTeX.  Do not use filepaths containing spaces:
you can always use the short forms (found by `dir /x' at the Windows
command line).  Network shares (with paths starting `\\') are not
supported.  For example, all on one line,

     PATH=c:\Rtools\bin;c:\Rtools\perl\bin;c:\Rtools\MinGW\bin;c:\texmf\miktex\bin;
          c:\R\bin;c:\windows;c:\windows\system32

   It is essential that the directory containing the command line tools
comes first or second in the path: there are typically like-named tools
in other directories, and they will *not* work.  The ordering of the
other directories is less important, but if in doubt, use the order
above.

   Edit `R_HOME/src/gnuwin32/MkRules' to set the appropriate paths as
needed.  *Beware*: `MkRules' contains tabs and some editors (e.g.,
WinEdt) silently remove them.

   Our toolset contains copies of Cygwin DLLs that may conflict with
other ones on your system if both are in the path at once.  The normal
recommendation is to delete the older ones; however, at one time we
found our tools did not work with a newer version of the Cygwin DLLs, so
it may be safest not to have any other version of the Cygwin DLLs in
your path.

D.1 Perl
========

Perl is needed to build R and to use `R CMD build|check|Rprof': it is
no longer needed to install packages.

   You will need a Windows port of `perl5' (but only the basic
functionality, not any of the third-party Win32 extensions).  The
Vanilla Perl (version 5.8.x) package is included in `Rtools.exe'. A
more full- featured distribution is available from
`http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/': other alternatives
are listed at `http://win32.perl.org/'.

   *Beware*: you do need a _Windows_ port and not the Cygwin one.
Users of 64-bit Windows can use a Win64 Perl (such as that from
ActiveState) if they prefer.


File: R-admin.info,  Node: LaTeX,  Next: The Inno Setup installer,  Prev: Perl,  Up: The Windows toolset

D.2 LaTeX
=========

The `MiKTeX' (`http://www.miktex.org/') distribution of LaTeX includes
a suitable port of `pdftex'.  The `basic' version of `MiKTeX' almost
suffices (the *grid* vignettes need `fancyvrb.sty'), but it will
install the 15Mb `lm' package if allowed to (although that is not
actually used).  The `Rtools.exe' installer does _not_ include any
version of LaTeX.

   Please read *Note Making the manuals:: about how to make `refman.pdf'
and set the environment variables `R_RD4DVI' and `R_RD4PDF' suitably;
ensure you have the required fonts installed.

D.3 The Inno Setup installer
============================

To make the installer package (`R-2.10.1-win32.exe') we require Inno
Setup 5.1.7 or later (including 5.3.x and the Unicode versions) from
`http://jrsoftware.org/'.  This is _not_ included in `Rtools.exe'.

   Edit file `src/gnuwin32/MkRules' and change `ISDIR' to the location
where Inno Setup was installed.

D.4 The command line tools
==========================

This item and the next are installed by the `Rtools.exe' installer.

   If you choose to install these yourself, you will need suitable
versions of at least `basename', `cat', `cmp', `comm', `cp', `cut',
`date', `diff', `echo', `find', `grep', `gzip', `ls', `make',
`makeinfo', `mkdir', `mv', `rm', `rsync', `sed', `sh', `sort', `tar',
`texindex', `touch', `tr' and `uniq'; we use those from the Cygwin
distribution (`http://www.cygwin.com/') or compiled from the sources.
You will also need `zip' and `unzip' from the Info-ZIP project
(`http://www.info-zip.org/').  All of these tools are in `Rtools.exe'.

   *Beware*: `Native' ports of make are *not* suitable (including that
at the mingw site).  There were also problems with several earlier
versions of the cygwin tools and DLLs.  To avoid frustration, please
use our tool set, and make sure it is at the front of your path
(including before the Windows system directories).  If you are using a
Windows shell, type `PATH' at the prompt to find out.

This version of R is set up to use `gcc' `4.2.1' for which MinGW
compilers were released in August 2007.  The `Rtools.exe' installer
currently includes the `-sjlj' version of `4.2.1' of the MinGW port of
`gcc' from `http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2435'.

   If you would like to install your own copy, we recommend downloading
from the URL above, as the download links from `http://www.mingw.org/'
have led to obsolete versions. See the notes on
`http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/' for updates.

   To download the components individually, currently you need

     mingw-runtime-3.13.tar.gz
     w32api-3.10.tar.gz
     binutils-2.17.50-20060824-1.tar.gz
     gcc-core-4.2.1-sjlj-2.tar.gz
     gcc-g++-4.2.1-sjlj-2.tar.gz
     gcc-gfortran-4.2.1-sjlj-2.tar.gz

(and `gcc-objc-4.2.1-sjlj-2.tar.gz' if you want Objective C support).
Unpack these into the same directory (using `tar zxf tarball_name').
(You may need to copy `bin/gcc-sjlj.exe' to `bin/gcc.exe' and a few
badly-written packages need `bin/g++-sjlj.exe' copied to
`bin/g++.exe'.)  This compiler should work on Windows Vista without any
workarounds.

   Note that `mingw-runtime-3.13.tar.gz' or later and `gcc-4.2.1' or
later are needed to get a correct build of R itself.  There are known
problems with using other compiler sets on Windows Vista and later
(`http://www.nabble.com/environment-hosed-during-upgrade-tf3305745.html#a9195667')
and the workaround is to set `PATH' to include the path to `cc1'.

   The MinGW build of `gcc-4.4.0' current in September 2009 failed to
build a properly functioning R.

D.6 Useful additional programs
==============================

Developers of packages will find some of the `goodies' at
`http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/goodies' useful.

   There is a version of the `file' command that identifies the type of
files, and is used by `Rcmd check' if available.

   The file `xzutils.zip' contains the program `xz' which can be used
to (de)compress files with that form of compression.
